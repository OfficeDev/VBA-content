    Set d = fs.GetDrive(drvpath)
    Select Case d.DriveType
        Case 0: t = "Unknown"
        Case 1: t = "Removable"
        Case 2: t = "Fixed"
        Case 3: t = "Network"
        Case 4: t = "CD-ROM"
        Case 5: t = "RAM Disk"
    End Select
    s = "Drive " &amp; d.DriveLetter &amp; ": - " &amp; t
    If d.IsReady Then 
        s = s &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Drive is Ready."
    Else
        s = s &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Drive is not Ready."
    End If
    MsgBox s
