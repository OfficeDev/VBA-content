# Run Project and Stop Project Commands (Run Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **Run Project**

Puts the project into a mode in which it can be used by other applications. This is used to debug and test the stand-alone project before building a  [dynamic-link library (DLL)](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (DLL) from it. The current project is registered, replacing any existing registration information for the project (the registry information for an existing DLL version of the project, for example).

 **Stop Project**
Unregisters the project, and restores any previous registry information. This makes the in-memory project no longer able to be called from other applications.

 **Note**  The  **Run Project** and **Stop Project** commands are available only to the current stand-alone project. They are not available to [host application](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) document projects.


 **Note**  This feature is not available in all versions of the Visual Basic Editor.
