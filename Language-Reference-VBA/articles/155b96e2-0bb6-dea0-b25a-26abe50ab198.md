# Object was unloaded (Error 364)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A form was unloaded from its own  **_Load** procedure. This error has the following cause and solution:




- A form with an  **Unload** statement in its **_Load** procedure was implicitly loaded. For example, the following will implicitly load `YourForm` if it isn't already loaded:
    
  ```
  MyForm.BackColor = YourForm.BackColor. 

  ```


    Remove the  **Unload** statement from the **Form_Load** procedure.
