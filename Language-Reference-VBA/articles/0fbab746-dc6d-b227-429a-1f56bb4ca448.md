# Object doesn't support this property or method (Error 438)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Not all objects support all  [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [methods](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You specified a method or property that doesn't exist for this  [Automation object](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    See the object's documentation for more information on the object and check the spellings of properties and methods.
    
- You specified a  **Friend** procedure to be called late bound. The name of a **Friend** procedure must be known at [compile time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). It can't appear in a late-bound call.
