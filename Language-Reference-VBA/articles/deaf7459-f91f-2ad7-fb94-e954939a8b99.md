# Unrecognized project language

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The specified code  [locale](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to be loaded isn't currently supported by this application. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- The project was created on a system that supports the code locale, but was then moved to a system where that code locale isn't recognized. For example, the ole2nls.dll on the current machine may be a version that doesn't recognize the code locale. Install the proper  [dynamic-link library (DLL)](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) on the current system.
    
- The correct  [object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the project was not found.
    
    Make sure the correct object libraries are available, for example, make sure your path includes their directories.
