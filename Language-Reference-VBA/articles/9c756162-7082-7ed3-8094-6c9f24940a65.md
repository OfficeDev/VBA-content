# Value Property (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns or sets a  [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the value of the [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Read/write.
 **Remarks**
Because the  **Value** property returns a **Variant**, you can access any property. To access a list, use the  **IndexedValue** property.
If the property that the  **Property** object represents is read/write, the **Value** property is read/write. If the property is read-only, attempting to set the **Value** property causes an error. If the property is write-only, attempting to return the **Value** property causes an error.
The  **Value** property is the default property for the **Property** object.
