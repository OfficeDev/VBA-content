 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Sets the current system date.

 **Syntax**

 **Date** **=**_date_
For systems running Microsoft Windows 95, the required  _date_ specification must be a date from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 2099. For systems running Microsoft Windows NT, _date_ must be a date from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 2079. For the Macintosh, _date_ must be a date from January 1, 1904 through February 5, 2040.

## Example

This example uses the  **Date** statement to set the computer system date. In the development environment, the date literal is displayed in short date format using the locale settings of your code.


```
Dim MyDate 
MyDate = #February 12, 1985# ' Assign a date. 
Date= MyDate ' Change system date. 

```
