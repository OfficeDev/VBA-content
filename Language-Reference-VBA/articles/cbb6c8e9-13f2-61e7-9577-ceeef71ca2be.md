 **Remarks**
The  **CurX** property applies to a multiline **TextBox** or **ComboBox**. The return value is valid when the object has the  [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
You can use  **CurTargetX** and **CurX** to position the insertion point as the user scrolls through the contents of a multiline **TextBox** or **ComboBox**. When the user moves the insertion point to another line of text by scrolling the content of the object,  **CurTargetX** specifies the preferred position for the insertion point. **CurX** is set to this value if the line of text is longer than the value of **CurTargetX**. Otherwise,  **CurX** is set to the end of the line of text.
