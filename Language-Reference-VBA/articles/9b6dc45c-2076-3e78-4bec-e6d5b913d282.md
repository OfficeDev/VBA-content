Visual Basic for Applications only supports  **UserForm** form objects. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You are trying to load a form from an earlier version of Visual Basic or a form from a current standalone version of Visual Basic. It is probably easiest to redesign the form using the  **UserForm** tools within Visual Basic for Applications. If you can save the form in [ASCII](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) format, you may be able to modify the form and import it. However, you must completely understand the formats and limitations of the various form packages.
