 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Contains the value of a control when that control receives the focus.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **BoundValue** [= _Variant_]
The  **BoundValue** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Variant_|Optional. The current state or content of the control.|
 **Settings**


|**Control**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **CheckBox**|An integer value indicating whether the item is selected:|
||Null Indicates the item is in a null state, neither selected nor  [cleared](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md).|
||-1 True. Indicates the item is selected.|
||0 False. Indicates the item is cleared.|
| **OptionButton**|Same as  **CheckBox**.|
| **ToggleButton**|Same as  **CheckBox**.|
| **ScrollBar**|An integer between the values specified for the  **Max** and **Min** properties.|
| **SpinButton**|Same as  **ScrollBar**.|
| **ComboBox, ListBox**|The value in the  **BoundColumn** of the currently selected rows.|
| **CommandButton**|Always  **False**.|
| **MultiPage**|An integer indicating the currently active page.|
||Zero (0) indicates the first page. The maximum value is one less than the number of pages.|
| **TextBox**|The text in the edit region.|
 **Remarks**
 **BoundValue** applies to the control that has the focus.
The contents of the  **BoundValue** and **Value** properties are identical most of the time. When the user edits a control so that its value changes, the contents of **BoundValue** and **Value** are different until the change is final.
Several things occur when the user changes the value of a control. For example, if a user changes the text in a  **TextBox**, the following things occur:


1. The  **Change** event is initiated. At this time the **Value** property contains the new text and **BoundValue** contains the previous text.
    
2. The  **BeforeUpdate** event is initiated.
    
3. The  **AfterUpdate** event is initiated. The values for **BoundValue** and **Value** are once again identical, containing the new text.
    

 **BoundValue** cannot be used with a multi-select list box.
