# Remove Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Removes an item from a  [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Remove(**_component_**)**
The  **Remove** syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An  [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _component_|Required. For the  **LinkedWindows** collection, an object. For the **References** collection, a reference to a [type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For the  **VBComponents** collection, an enumerated [constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) representing a [class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), a form, or a  [standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For the  **VBProjects** collection, a standalone project.|
 **Remarks**
When used on the  **LinkedWindows** collection, the **Remove** method removes a window from the collection of currently [linked windows](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The removed window becomes a floating window that has its own  [linked window frame](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The  **Remove** method can only be used on a standalone project. It generates a run-time error if you try to use it on a host project.


 **Important**  Objects, properties, and methods for controlling linked windows, linked window frames, and docked windows are included on the Macintosh for compatibility with code written in Windows. However, these language elements generate run-time errors when run on the Macintosh.
