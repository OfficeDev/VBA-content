# ActiveWindow Property (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns the active window in the  [development environment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Read-only.
 **Remarks**
When more than one window is open in the development environment, the  **ActiveWindow** property setting is the window with the [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). If the main window has the focus,  **ActiveWindow** returns **Nothing**.
