 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  [constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) must be initialized. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You tried to initialize a constant with a  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and instance of a  [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), an object, or the return value of a function call.
    
    Initialize constants with literals, previously declared constants, or literals and constants joined by operators (except the  **Is** logical operator).
    
-  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)
    
    To declare a dynamic array within a  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), declare the array with  **ReDim** and specify the number of elements with a variable.
