# Stop Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Suspends execution.

 **Syntax**

 **Stop**
 **Remarks**
You can place  **Stop** statements anywhere in [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to suspend execution. Using the **Stop** statement is similar to setting a [breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the code.
The  **Stop** statement suspends execution, but unlike **End**, it doesn't close any files or clear  [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), unless it is in a compiled executable (.exe) file.

## Example

This example uses the  **Stop** statement to suspend execution for each iteration through the **For...Next** loop.


```
Dim I 
For I = 1 To 10 ' Start For...Next loop. 
 Debug.Print I ' Print I to the Immediate window. 
 Stop ' Stop during each iteration. 
Next I 

```
