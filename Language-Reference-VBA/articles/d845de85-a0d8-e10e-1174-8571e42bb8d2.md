# MacScript Function

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Executes an AppleScript script and returns a value returned by the script, if any.
 **Syntax**
 **MacScript**_script_
The  _script_ argument is a [String expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The  **String** expression either can be a series of AppleScript commands or can specify the name of an AppleScript script or a script file.
 **Remarks**
Multiline scripts can be created by embedding carriage-return characters ( **Chr(**13 **)**).

## Example

This example uses the  **MacScript** function to open the **Choose File** dialog box (the Macintosh standard-file dialog). The full path of the file chosen by the user is returned. If appropriate, the path specification is preceded by the type of the file.


```
ThePath$ = Macscript("ChooseFile")


```
