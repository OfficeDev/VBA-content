# Load Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Loads an object but doesn't show it.

 **Syntax**

 **Load**_object_
The  _object_ placeholder represents an [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.
 **Remarks**
When an object is loaded, it is placed in memory, but isn't visible. Use the  **Show** method to make the object visible. Until an object is visible, a user can't interact with it. The object can be manipulated programmatically in its Initialize event procedure.

## Example

In the following example, UserForm2 is loaded during UserForm1's Initialize event. Subsequent clicking on UserForm2 reveals UserForm1.


```
' This is the Initialize event procedure for UserForm1 
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 Load UserForm2 
 UserForm2.Show 
End Sub 
' This is the Click event of UserForm2 
Private Sub UserForm_Click() 
 UserForm2.Hide 
End Sub 
 
' This is the click event for UserForm1 
Private Sub UserForm_Click() 
 UserForm2.Show 
End Sub 

```
