# Stop Code Execution

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

As you run your code, it may stop executing for one of the following reasons:




- An untrapped  [run-time error](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) occurs.
    
- A trapped run-time error occurs, and  **Break on All Errors** is selected on the **General** tab in the **Options** dialog box.
    
- A  [breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is encountered.
    
- A  **Stop** statement is encountered in your code, switching the mode to [break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
- An  **End** statement is encountered in your code, switching the mode to [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
- You halt execution manually at a given point.
    
- A  [watch expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that you set to break if its value changes or becomes true is encountered.
    

 **To halt execution manually**


- To switch to break mode, from the  **Run** menu, choose **Break** (CTRL+BREAK), or use the toolbar shortcut:

- To switch to design time, from the  **Run** menu, choose **Reset <projectname&gt;**, or use the toolbar shortcut: 
![](../images/tbr_end_ZA01201701.gif).
    

 **To continue execution when your application has halted**


- From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Step Into** (F8), **Step Over** (SHIFT+F8), **Step Out** (CTRL+SHIFT+F8), or **Run To Cursor** (CTRL+F8.
