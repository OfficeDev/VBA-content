# #Else clause must be preceded by a matching #If

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

# **Else** is a conditional compilation directive. This error has the following cause and solution:




- An # **Else** clause was detected that isn't preceded by a matching # **If** or # **ElseIf**. Check to see if a preceding # **If** has been separated from this # **Else** by an # **End If**. Note that only one # **Else** is permitted in each # **If** block, so two successive # **Else** clauses cause this error.
