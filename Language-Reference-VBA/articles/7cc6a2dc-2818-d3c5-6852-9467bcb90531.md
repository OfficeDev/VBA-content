# Select Case without End Select

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Each  **Select Case** construct must be terminated with an **End Select** statement. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You used a  **Select Case** statement without a corresponding **End Select** statement. Check if there is an incorrectly matched **Select Case...End Select** structure inside an outer **Select Case...End Select** structure. If you have nested **Select Case** statements, each must have a matching **End Select**.
