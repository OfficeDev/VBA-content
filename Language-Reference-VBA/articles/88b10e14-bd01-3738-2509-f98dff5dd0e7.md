# Object does not have a Property Let procedure

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can't assign a value to a  [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) unless it has exposed a **Property Let** method. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You tried to assign a value to a property that hasn't exposed a  **Property Let** method. You can't directly assign a value to this property. If you created the [class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), you can modify the interface by exposing a  **Property Let** method. Otherwise, check the component's documentation to determine if there is an indirect method for assigning the value.
