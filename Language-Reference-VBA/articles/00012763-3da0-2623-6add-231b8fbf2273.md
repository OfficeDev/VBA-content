6. To set limits on the search, select:
    
    
    
      -  **Find Whole Word Only** to search for the complete word by itself, and not as part of another word.
    
  -  **Match Case** for an exact match.
    
  -  **Use Pattern Matching** to use wildcard characters.
    

    
    
7. Choose  **Find Next** if you want to confirm the change before replacing the text; choose **Replace** to replace the highlighted occurrence of the found text and automatically perform a **Find Next**; or choose  **Replace All** to change all occurrences of the search text automatically.
