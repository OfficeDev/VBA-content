# Invalid syntax for conditional compiler constant declarations

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Entering  [conditional compiler constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in an **Options** dialog box differs from declaring [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in code. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You used improper syntax when entering a constant declaration in the in an  **Options** dialog box. The only valid syntax is a simple assignment of an integer value to the [identifier](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Make sure the syntax for the entry is as follows, with each constant separated by a colon ( **:**):
    
  ```
  constantname= [{+ | - }]integervalue: [{+ | - }]constantname=integervalue [...] 

  ```
