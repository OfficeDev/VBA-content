# Add-in can't reference project

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 [Projects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are dynamic, but [add-ins](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are static. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to create an add-in from a  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that references another project.
    
    The semantics of projects can change in a way that affects referencing projects and add-ins. Therefore, you can't create an add-in from a project that references projects.
