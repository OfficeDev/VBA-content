# Set and Clear a Breakpoint

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You set a  [breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to suspend execution at a specific statement in a [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); for example, where you suspect problems may exist. You clear breakpoints when you no longer need them to stop execution.

 **To set a breakpoint**



1. Position the insertion point anywhere in a line of the  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) where you want execution to halt.
    
2. On the  **Debug** menu, click **Toggle Breakpoint** (F9), click next to the statement in the **Margin Indicator Bar** (if visible), or use the toolbar shortcut:

If you set a breakpoint on a line that contains several statements separated by colons ( **:**), the break always occurs at the first statement on the line.
 **To clear a breakpoint**


1. Position the insertion point anywhere on a line of the procedure containing the breakpoint.
    
2. From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Toggle Breakpoint** (F9), or click next to the statement in the **Margin Indicator Bar** (if visible).
    
3. The breakpoint is cleared and highlighting is removed.
    

 **To clear all breakpoints in the application**


- From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Clear All Breakpoints** (CTRL+SHIFT+F9).
    
     **Note**  Breakpoints set in code are not saved when you save your code.
