# SpinButton Control

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Increments and decrements numbers.
 **Remarks**
Clicking a  **SpinButton** changes only the value of the **SpinButton**. You can write code that uses the  **SpinButton** to update the displayed value of another control. For example, you can use a **SpinButton** to change the month, the day, or the year shown on a date. You can also use a **SpinButton** to scroll through a range of values or a list of items, or to change the value displayed in a text box.
To display a value updated by a  **SpinButton**, you must assign the value of the  **SpinButton** to the displayed portion of a control, such as the **Caption** property of a **Label** or the **Text** property of a **TextBox**. To create a horizontal or vertical  **SpinButton**, drag the sizing handles of the  **SpinButton** horizontally or vertically on the form.
The default property for a  **SpinButton** is the **Value** property.
The default event for a  **SpinButton** is the Change event.
