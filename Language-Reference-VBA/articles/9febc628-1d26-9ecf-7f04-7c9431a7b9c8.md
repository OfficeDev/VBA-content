# AddControl Event

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Occurs when a control is inserted onto a form, a  **Frame**, or a  **Page** of a **MultiPage**.
 **Syntax**
For Frame **Private Sub**_object__**AddControl( )**
For MultiPage **Private Sub**_object__**AddControl(**_index_**As Long**,  _ctrl_**As Control)**
The  **AddControl** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _index_|Required. The index of the  **Page** that will contain the new control.|
| _ctrl_|Required. The control to be added.|
 **Remarks**
The AddControl event occurs when a control is added at  [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This event is not initiated when you add a control at  [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), nor is it initiated when a form is initially loaded and displayed at run time.
The default action of this event is to add a control to the specified form,  **Frame**, or  **MultiPage**.
The  **Add** method initiates the AddControl event.
