 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns an  [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) representing the next [file number](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) available for use by the **Open** statement.
 **Syntax**
 **FreeFile**[ **(**_rangenumber_**)**]
The optional  _rangenumber_ argument is a [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that specifies the range from which the next free file number is to be returned. Specify a 0 (default) to return a file number in the range 1 - 255, inclusive. Specify a 1 to return a file number in the range 256 - 511.
 **Remarks**
Use  **FreeFile** to supply a file number that is not already in use.

## Example

This example uses the  **FreeFile** function to return the next available file number. Five files are opened for output within the loop, and some sample data is written to each.


```
Dim MyIndex, FileNumber
For MyIndex = 1 To 5    ' Loop 5 times.
    FileNumber = FreeFile    ' Get unused file
        ' number.
    Open "TEST" &amp; MyIndex For Output As #FileNumber    ' Create file name.
    Write #FileNumber, "This is a sample."    ' Output text.
    Close #FileNumber    ' Close file.
Next MyIndex


```
