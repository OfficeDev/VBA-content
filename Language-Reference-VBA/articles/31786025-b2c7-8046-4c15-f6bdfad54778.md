# Type mismatch: array or user-defined type expected

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The type of an  [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) includes whether or not it is an [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or a [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- Your argument specified a single element of an array or user-defined type, or a simple  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), literal, or  [constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). However, it is being passed to a parameter that expects a whole array or user-defined type.
    
    Either change the argument or change the definition of the parameter.
    
- Your argument specified an array or user-defined type, but it was not of the same type as the parameter. Either pass an array of the expected type or change the definition of the parameter declaration.
