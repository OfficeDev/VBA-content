 **Remarks**
All option buttons in a  **Frame** are mutually exclusive, so you can use the **Frame** to create an option group. You can also use a **Frame** to group controls with closely related contents.For example, in an application that processes customer orders, you might use a **Frame** to group the name, address, and account number of customers.
You can also use a  **Frame** to create a group of toggle buttons, but the toggle buttons are not mutually exclusive.
The default event for a  **Frame** is the Click event.
