# Invalid ordinal (Error 452)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Your call to a  [dynamic-link library (DLL)](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) indicated to use a number instead of a procedure name, using the **#**_num_ syntax. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- An attempt to convert the  _num_ expression to an ordinal failed. Make sure the [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) represents a valid number or call the [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by name.
    
- The  _num_ specified doesn't specify any function in the DLL. Make sure _num_ identifies a valid function in the DLL.
    
- A  [type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) has an invalid declaration resulting in internal use of an invalid ordinal number.
    
     [Comment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) out code to isolate the procedure call causing the problem. Write a **Declare** statement for the procedure and report the problem to the type library vendor.
