# Expected procedure, not user-defined type

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

There is no  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name in the current [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but there is a  [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name. You can call a procedure, but not a user-defined type. This error has the following cause and solution:




- The name of a user-defined type is used as a procedure call. Check the spelling of the procedure name, and make sure the procedure you are trying to call isn't private to another  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
