# SaveAs Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Saves a project to a given location using a new filename.
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.SaveAs** **(**_newfilename_**As String)**
The  **SaveAs** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|An  [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _newfilename_|Required. A  [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the new filename for the component to be saved.|
 **Remarks**
If a new path name is given, it is used. Otherwise, the old path name is used. If the new filename is invalid or refers to a read-only file, an error occurs.
The  **SaveAs** method can only be used on standalone projects. It generates a run-time error if you use it with a host project.
