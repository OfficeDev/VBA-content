There is a general problem reading from a disk. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- The disk drive door is improperly closed. If the disk is removable, check the drive door. Close it properly if necessary.
    
- The disk may be inserted upside down. Reinsert the disk right-side up.
    
- The disk may not be properly formatted. Reformat the disk if you are willing to lose the data it currently contains.
    
- You are experiencing network problems. Try restarting your network.
