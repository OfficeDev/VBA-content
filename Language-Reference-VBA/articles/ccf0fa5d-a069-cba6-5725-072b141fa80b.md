# BeforeUpdate Event

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Occurs before data in a control is changed.
 **Syntax**
 **Private Sub**_object__**BeforeUpdate( ByVal**_Cancel_**As MSForms.ReturnBoolean)**
The  **BeforeUpdate** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Cancel_|Required. Event status.  **False** indicates that the control should handle the event (default). **True** cancels the update and indicates the application should handle the event.|
 **Remarks**
The BeforeUpdate event occurs regardless of whether the control is  [bound](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) (that is, when the **RowSource** property specifies a [data source](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) for the control). This event occurs before the AfterUpdate and Exit events for the control (and before the Enter event for the next control that receives [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)).
If you set the  _Cancel_ argument to **True**, the focus remains on the control and neither the AfterUpdate event nor the Exit event occurs.
