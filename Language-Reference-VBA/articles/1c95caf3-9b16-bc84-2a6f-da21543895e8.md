# Else without If

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

An  **Else** must be preceded by an **If**. This error has the following cause and solution:




- An  **Else** statement was used without a corresponding **If** statement. Check other control structures within the **If...End If** structure and verify that they are correctly matched. Also check that the block **If** is correctly formatted.
