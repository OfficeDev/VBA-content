# SaveSetting Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Saves or creates an application entry in the application's entry in the Windows  [registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or (on the Macintosh) information in the application's initialization file.

 **Syntax**

 **SaveSetting  _appname_,** **_section,_**_key, setting_
The  **SaveSetting** statement syntax has these [named arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **_appname_**|Required.  [String expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing the name of the application or [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to which the setting applies. On the Macintosh, this is the filename of the initialization file in the Preferences folder in the System folder.|
| **_section_**|Required. String expression containing the name of the section where the key setting is being saved.|
| **_key_**|Required. String expression containing the name of the key setting being saved.|
| **_setting_**|Required.  [Expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing the value that **_key_** is being set to.|
 **Remarks**
An error occurs if the key setting can't be saved for any reason.

## Example

The following example first uses the  **SaveSetting** statement to make entries in the Windows registry (or .ini file on 16-bit Windows platforms) for the application, and then uses the **DeleteSetting** statement to remove them.


```
' Place some settings in the registry. 
SaveSetting appname := "MyApp", section := "Startup", _ 
 key := "Top", setting := 75 
SaveSetting "MyApp","Startup", "Left", 50 
' Remove section and all its settings from registry. 
DeleteSetting "MyApp", "Startup" 

```
