# Indent Command (Edit Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Shifts all lines in the selection to the next tab stop. If you place the cursor anywhere in a line and choose the Indent command, the entire line is shifted to the next tab stop. All lines in the selection are moved the same number of spaces to retain the same relative indentation within the selected block.

You can change the tab width on the  **Editor** tab of the **Options** dialog box.
