# Writing Declaration Statements

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You use declaration statements to name and define  [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [arrays](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and  [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). When you declare a procedure, variable, or constant, you also define its  [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), depending on where you place the declaration and what  [keywords](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) you use to declare it.

The following example contains three declarations.




```
Sub ApplyFormat() 
    Const limit As Integer = 33 
    Dim myCell As Range 
    ' More statements 
End Sub 

```

The  **Sub** statement (with matching **End Sub** statement) declares a procedure named `ApplyFormat`. All the statements enclosed by the  **Sub** and **End Sub** statements are executed whenever the `ApplyFormat` procedure is called or run.
The  **Const** statement declares the constant `limit` specifying the **Integer** data type and a value of 33.
The  **Dim** statement declares the `myCell` variable. The data type is an object, in this case, a Microsoft Excel **Range** object. You can declare a variable to be any object that is exposed in the application you are using. **Dim** statements are one type of statement used to declare variables. Other keywords used in declarations are **ReDim**,  **Static**,  **Public**,  **Private**, and  **Const**.
