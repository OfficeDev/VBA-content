# Type Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Used at  [module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to define a user-defined [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing one or more elements.

 **Syntax**

[ **Private** | **Public**]  **Type**_varname_
 _elementname_ [ **(**[ _subscripts_] **)**]  **As**_type_
 [ _elementname_ [ **(**[ _subscripts_] **)**]  **As**_type_]
 **. . .**
 **End Type**
The  **Type** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Public**|Optional. Used to declare  [user-defined types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that are available to all [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in all [modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in all [projects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| **Private**|Optional. Used to declare user-defined types that are available only within the module where the  [declaration](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is made.|
| _varname_|Required. Name of the user-defined type; follows standard  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) naming conventions.|
| _elementname_|Required. Name of an element of the user-defined type. Element names also follow standard variable naming conventions, except that  [keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)s can be used.|
| _subscripts_|When not explicitly stated in  _lower_, the lower bound of an array is controlled by the  **Option** **Base** statement. The lower bound is zero if no **Option** **Base** statement is present.|
| _type_|Required. Data type of the element; may be  [Byte](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Boolean](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Currency](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Single](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Double](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Decimal](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (not currently supported), [Date](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (for variable-length strings), **String** * _length_ (for fixed-length strings), [Object](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), another user-defined type, or an  [object type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
 **Remarks**
The  **Type** statement can be used only at module level. Once you have declared a user-defined type using the **Type** statement, you can declare a variable of that type anywhere within the [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the declaration. Use **Dim**,  **Private**,  **Public**,  **ReDim**, or  **Static** to declare a variable of a user-defined type.
In  [standard modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [class modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), user-defined types are public by default. This visibility can be changed using the  **Private** keyword.
 [Line numbers](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [line labels](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't allowed in **Type...End Type** blocks.
User-defined types are often used with data records, which frequently consist of a number of related elements of different data types.
The following example shows the use of fixed-size arrays in a user-defined type:



```
Type StateData 
    CityCode (1 To 100) As Integer    ' Declare a static array. 
    County As String * 30 
End Type 
 
Dim Washington(1 To 100) As StateData 

```

In the preceding example,  `StateData` includes the `CityCode` static array, and the record `Washington` has the same structure as `StateData`.
When you declare a fixed-size array within a user-defined type, its dimensions must be declared with numeric literals or  [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) rather than variables.

## Example

This example uses the  **Type** statement to define a user-defined data type. The **Type** statement is used at the module level only. If it appears in a class module, a **Type** statement must be preceded by the keyword **Private**.


```
Type EmployeeRecord    ' Create user-defined type. 
    ID As Integer    ' Define elements of data type. 
    Name As String * 20 
    Address As String * 30 
    Phone As Long 
    HireDate As Date 
End Type 
Sub CreateRecord() 
    Dim MyRecord As EmployeeRecord    ' Declare variable. 
 
    ' Assignment to EmployeeRecord variable must occur in a procedure. 
    MyRecord.ID = 12003    ' Assign a value to an element. 
End Sub 

```
