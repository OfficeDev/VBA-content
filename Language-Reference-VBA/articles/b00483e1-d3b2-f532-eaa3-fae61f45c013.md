# Module too large

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) contains code within the [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- There is too much code in the module.
    
    Create a new module and move some of the  [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from this module to the new one. If the current module contains [module-level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) declarations of data that must be visible to the procedures in the new module, declare that data as **Public**.
    
     **Note**   [Comments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't counted as lines of code. Therefore, deleting comments doesn't prevent this error.
