# Must be first statement on the line

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Not all  [keywords](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can appear at the beginning of a line of code. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You preceded a  **Sub**,  **Function**, or  **Property** statement with another statement on the same line. A **Sub**,  **Function**, or  **Property** statement must always be the first statement on any line in which it appears (unless preceded by the keyword **Public**,  **Private**, or  **Static**).
    
- You preceded an  **End If**,  **Else**, or  **ElseIf** statement with another statement on the same line. An **End If**,  **Else**, or  **ElseIf** (only when used in a block **If** structure) statement must always be the first statement on any line in which it appears.
