## Tab Options

 **Project Name**

Identifies your component in the Windows Registry and the  **Object** **Browser**. It is important that it has a unique name.

The project name is the name of the  _type library_ for your component. The type library, or TypeLib, contains the description of the objects and interfaces provided by your component.

It is also used to qualify the names of classes. A combination of project name and class name is sometimes referred to as a  _fully qualified class name_, or as a  _programmatic ID_. The fully qualified class name may be required to correctly identify an object as belonging to your component.

 **Help File Name**

Displays the name of the Help file associated with the project.

 **Project Description**

Sets the descriptive text that is displayed in the  **Description** pane at the bottom of the **Object** **Browser**.

 **Project Help Context ID**
