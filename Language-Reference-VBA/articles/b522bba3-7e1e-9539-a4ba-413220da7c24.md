# Specified ActiveX component not correctly registered or not found

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A component should be registered in the system  [registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- The component's registry information is incorrect, so the component can't be found. Correct the registry. Reinstall the component, if necessary.
    
- The component was removed by deleting it instead of using an uninstall program. Replace the component files in the directory specified in the registry.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
