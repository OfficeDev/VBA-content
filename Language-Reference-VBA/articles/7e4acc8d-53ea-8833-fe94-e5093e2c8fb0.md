# Remove <Item> Command (File Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Permanently deletes the active  [form](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from the project. Not available when an item is not selected in the **Project** **Explorer**.

When removing a module from a project, make sure the remaining code doesn't refer to the removed item.

Before your item is deleted, you are asked if you want to export it as a file. If you click Yes in the message box, the  **Export** **File** dialog box opens. If you click No, the item is deleted.


 **Important**  You cannot undo this action.
