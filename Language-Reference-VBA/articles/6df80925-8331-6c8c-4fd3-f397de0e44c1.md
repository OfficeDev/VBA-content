# Like Operator

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Used to compare two strings.
 **Syntax**
 _result_**=**_string_**Like**_pattern_
The  **Like** operator syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _result_|Required; any numeric  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| _string_|Required; any  [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| _pattern_|Required; any string expression conforming to the pattern-matching conventions described in Remarks.|
 **Remarks**
If  _string_ matches _pattern_,  _result_ is **True**; if there is no match,  _result_ is **False**. If either  _string_ or _pattern_ is [Null](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  _result_ is **Null**.
The behavior of the  **Like** operator depends on the **Option Compare** statement. The default [string-comparison](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) method for each [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is **Option Compare** **Binary**.
 **Option Compare Binary** results in string comparisons based on a [sort order](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) derived from the internal binary representations of the characters. Sort order is determined by the code page. In the following example, a typical binary sort order is shown:
A < B < E < Z < a < b < e < z < Ã€ < ÃŠ < Ã˜ < Ã  < Ãª < Ã¸
 **Option Compare Text** results in string comparisons based on a case-insensitive, textual sort order determined by your system's [locale](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). When you sort the same characters using  **Option Compare Text**, the following text sort order is produced:
(A=a) < (Ã€=Ã ) < (B=b) < (E=e) < (ÃŠ=Ãª) < (Z=z) < (Ã˜=Ã¸)
Built-in pattern matching provides a versatile tool for string comparisons. The pattern-matching features allow you to use wildcard characters, character lists, or character ranges, in any combination, to match strings. The following table shows the characters allowed in  _pattern_ and what they match:


|**Characters in  _pattern_**|**Matches in  _string_**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **?**|Any single character.|
| *****|Zero or more characters.|
| **#**|Any single digit (0-9).|
|[ _charlist_]|Any single character in  _charlist_.|
|[ **!**_charlist_]|Any single character not in  _charlist_.|
A group of one or more characters ( _charlist_) enclosed in brackets ( **[ ]**) can be used to match any single character in  _string_ and can include almost any [character code](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), including digits.

 **Note**  To match the special characters left bracket ( **[**), question mark ( **?**), number sign ( **#**), and asterisk ( *****), enclose them in brackets. The right bracket ( **]**) can't be used within a group to match itself, but it can be used outside a group as an individual character.

By using a hyphen ( **-**) to separate the upper and lower bounds of the range,  _charlist_ can specify a range of characters. For example, `[A-Z]` results in a match if the corresponding character position in _string_ contains any uppercase letters in the range A-Z. Multiple ranges are included within the brackets without delimiters.
The meaning of a specified range depends on the character ordering valid at  [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (as determined by **Option Compare** and the [locale](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) setting of the system the code is running on). Using the **Option Compare Binary** example, the range `[A-E]` matches A, B and E. With **Option Compare Text**,  `[A-E]` matches A, a, Ã€, Ã , B, b, E, e. The range does not match ÃŠ or Ãª because accented characters fall after unaccented characters in the sort order.
Other important rules for pattern matching include the following:

- An exclamation point ( **!**) at the beginning of  _charlist_ means that a match is made if any character except the characters in _charlist_ is found in _string_. When used outside brackets, the exclamation point matches itself.
    
- A hyphen ( **-**) can appear either at the beginning (after an exclamation point if one is used) or at the end of  _charlist_ to match itself. In any other location, the hyphen is used to identify a range of characters.
    
- When a range of characters is specified, they must appear in ascending sort order (from lowest to highest).  `[A-Z]` is a valid pattern, but `[Z-A]` is not.
    
- The character sequence  `[]` is considered a zero-length string ("").
    

In some languages, there are special characters in the alphabet that represent two separate characters. For example, several languages use the character "Ã¦" to represent the characters "a" and "e" when they appear together. The  **Like** operator recognizes that the single special character and the two individual characters are equivalent.
When a language that uses a special character is specified in the system locale settings, an occurrence of the single special character in either  _pattern_ or _string_ matches the equivalent 2-character sequence in the other string. Similarly, a single special character in _pattern_ enclosed in brackets (by itself, in a list, or in a range) matches the equivalent 2-character sequence in _string_.

## Example

This example uses the  **Like** operator to compare a string to a pattern.


```
Dim MyCheck
MyCheck = "aBBBa" Like "a*a"    ' Returns True.
MyCheck = "F" Like "[A-Z]"    ' Returns True.
MyCheck = "F" Like "[!A-Z]"    ' Returns False.
MyCheck = "a2a" Like "a#a"    ' Returns True.
MyCheck = "aM5b" Like "a[L-P]#[!c-e]"    ' Returns True.
MyCheck = "BAT123khg" Like "B?T*"    ' Returns True.
MyCheck = "CAT123khg" Like "B?T*"    ' Returns False.
```
