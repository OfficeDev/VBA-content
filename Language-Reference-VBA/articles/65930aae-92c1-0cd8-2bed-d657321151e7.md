# BackStyle Property (Microsoft Forms)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns or sets the background style for an object.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **BackStyle** [= _fmBackStyle_]
The  **BackStyle** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _fmBackStyle_|Optional. Specifies the control background.|
 **Settings**
The settings for  _fmBackStyle_ are:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _fmBackStyleTransparent_|0|The background is transparent.|
| _fmBackStyleOpaque_|1|The background is opaque (default).|
 **Remarks**
The  **BackStyle** property determines whether a control is [transparent](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md). If  **BackStyle** is **fmBackStyleOpaque**, the control is not transparent and you cannot see anything behind the control on a form. If  **BackStyle** is **fmBackStyleTransparent**, you can see through the control and look at anything on the form located behind the control.

 **Note**   **BackStyle** does not affect the transparency of bitmaps. You must use a picture editor such as Paintbrush to make a bitmap transparent. Not all controls support transparent bitmaps.
