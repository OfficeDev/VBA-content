# Add items to a list using the List or Column property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015



1. Create a multicolumn  **ListBox** or **ComboBox**.
    
2. Create a two-dimensional  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that contains the items you want to put in the list.
    
3. Set the  **ColumnCount** property of the **ListBox** or **ComboBox** to match the number of entries in the list.
    
4. Do one of the following:
    
    
    
      - Assign the array as the value of the  **List** property. The contents of the **ListBox** will match the contents of the array exactly.
    
  - Assign the array as the value of the  **Column** property. **Column** transposes rows and columns, so each row of the **ListBox** matches the corresponding column of the array.
