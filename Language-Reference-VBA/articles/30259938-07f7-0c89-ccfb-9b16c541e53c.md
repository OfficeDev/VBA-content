# Array argument must be ByRef

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 [Arrays](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) declared with **Dim**,  **ReDim**, or  **Static** can't be passed **ByVal**. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to pass a whole array  **ByVal**. An individual element of an array can be passed  **ByVal** ( [by value](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)), but a whole array must be passed  **ByRef** ( [by reference](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)). Note that  **ByRef** is the default. If you must pass an array **ByVal** to prevent changes to the array's elements from being propagated back to the caller, you can pass the array [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in its own set of parentheses, or you can place it into a **Variant**, and then pass the  **Variant** to the **ByVal** parameter, as follows:
    
  ```
  Dim MyVar As Variant 
MyVar = OldArray() 

  ```
