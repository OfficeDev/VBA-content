# What is a control tip?

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A control tip is a brief phrase that describes a control, a  **Page**, or a  **Tab**. The control tip appears when the user briefly holds the mouse pointer over a control without clicking. A control tip is very similar to a ToolTip. The difference is that Microsoft Forms provides ToolTips to developers at design time, and developers provide control tips to end-users at run time.

If you assign a control tip to a  **MultiPage** or a **TabStrip**, control tips for the individual  **Page** or **Tab** objects within the **MultiPage** or **TabStrip** are not displayed.
