 **Remarks**
Use the  **TopLine** property to return or set the line showing at the top of the code pane. For example, if you want line 25 to be the first line showing in a code pane, set the **TopLine** property to 25.
The  **TopLine** property setting must be a positive number. If the **TopLine** property setting is greater than the actual number of lines in the code pane, the setting will be the last line in the code pane.
