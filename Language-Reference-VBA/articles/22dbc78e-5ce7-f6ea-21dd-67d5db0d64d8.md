# Enum Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Declares a type for an enumeration.

 **Syntax**

[ **Public** | **Private**]  **Enum**_name_
 _membername_ [= _constantexpression_]
 _membername_ [= _constantexpression_]
 **. . .**
 **End Enum**
The  **Enum** statement has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Public**|Optional. Specifies that the  **Enum** type is visible throughout the [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).  **Enum** types are **Public** by default.|
| **Private**|Optional. Specifies that the  **Enum** type is visible only within the [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in which it appears.|
| _name_|Required. The name of the  **Enum** type. The _name_ must be a valid Visual Basic identifier and is specified as the type when declaring [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [parameters](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the **Enum** type.|
| _membername_|Required. A valid Visual Basic identifier specifying the name by which a constituent element of the  **Enum** type will be known.|
| _constantexpression_|Optional. Value of the element (evaluates to a  **Long**). If no  _constantexpression_ is specified, the value assigned is either zero (if it is the first _membername_), or 1 greater than the value of the immediately preceding  _membername_.|
 **Remarks**
Enumeration variables are variables declared with an  **Enum** type. Both variables and parameters can be declared with an **Enum** type. The elements of the **Enum** type are initialized to constant values within the **Enum** statement. The assigned values can't be modified at [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and can include both positive and negative numbers. For example:



```
Enum SecurityLevel 
 IllegalEntry = -1 
 SecurityLevel1 = 0 
 SecurityLevel2 = 1 
End Enum 

```

An  **Enum** statement can appear only at [module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Once the  **Enum** type is defined, it can be used to declare variables, parameters, or [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) returning its type. You can't qualify an **Enum** type name with a module name. **Public** **Enum** types in a [class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are not members of the class; however, they are written to the [type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).  **Enum** types defined in [standard modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't written to type libraries. **Public Enum** types of the same name can't be defined in both standard modules and class modules, since they share the same name space. When two **Enum** types in different type libraries have the same name, but different elements, a reference to a variable of the type depends on which type library has higher priority in the **References**.
You can't use an  **Enum** type as the target in a **With** block.

## Example

The following example shows the  **Enum** statement used to define a collection of named constants. In this case, the constants are colors you might choose to design data entry forms for a database.


```
Public Enum InterfaceColors 
 icMistyRose = &amp;HE1E4FF&amp; 
 icSlateGray = &amp;H908070&amp; 
 icDodgerBlue = &amp;HFF901E&amp; 
 icDeepSkyBlue = &amp;HFFBF00&amp; 
 icSpringGreen = &amp;H7FFF00&amp; 
 icForestGreen = &amp;H228B22&amp; 
 icGoldenrod = &amp;H20A5DA&amp; 
 icFirebrick = &amp;H2222B2&amp; 
End Enum
```
