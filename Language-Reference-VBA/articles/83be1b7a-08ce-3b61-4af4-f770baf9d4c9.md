# With object must be user-defined type, Object, or Variant

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **With...End With** block can't be used with all [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) types. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to use a variable that was not of  **Object** type, [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or  [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) type containing an object within a **With** block.
    
    Check to see if you misspelled the name of the object, user-defined type, or  **Variant** variable.
