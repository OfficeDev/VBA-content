# SelLength Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


The number of characters selected in a text box or the text portion of a combo box.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **SelLength** [= _Long_]
The  **SelLength** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Long_|Optional. A numeric expression specifying the number of characters selected. For  **SelLength** and **SelStart**, the valid range of settings is 0 to the total number of characters in the edit area of a  **ComboBox** or **TextBox**.|
 **Remarks**
The  **SelLength** property is always valid, even when the control does not have [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Setting  **SelLength** to a value less than zero creates an error. Attempting to set **SelLength** to a value greater than the number of characters available in a control results in a value equal to the number of characters in the control.

 **Note**  Changing the value of the  **SelStart** property cancels any existing selection in the control, places an insertion point in the text, and sets **SelLength** to zero.

The default value, zero, means that no text is currently selected.
