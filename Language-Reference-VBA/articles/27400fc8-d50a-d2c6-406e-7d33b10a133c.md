# Statement too complex

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Visual Basic is unable to analyze this statement. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- Your statement can't be parsed due to its complexity. Try breaking the statement into several smaller components or replace complex conditional clauses with a combination of logical operators and  **If...Then...Else** statements.
    
- Your statement or function uses too many nested function calls. Make function calls earlier and assign the results to specific  [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); then use the variables in the statement that is causing the complexity error.
