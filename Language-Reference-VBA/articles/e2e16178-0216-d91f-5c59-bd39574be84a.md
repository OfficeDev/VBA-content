Allows you to:



- Type or paste a line of code and press ENTER to run it.
    
- Copy and paste the code from the  **Immediate** window into the **Code** window but does not allow you to save code in the **Immediate** window.
    

The  **Immediate** window can be dragged and positioned anywhere on your screen unless you have made it a dockable window from the **Docking** Tab of the **Options** dialog box.
You can close the window by clicking the Close box. If the Close box is not visible, double-click the Title bar to make the Close box visible, then click it.

 **Note**  In break mode, a statement in the Immediate window is executed in the context or  [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that is displayed in the Procedure box. For example, if you type **Print**_variablename_, your output is the value of a local variable. This is the same as if the  **Print** method had occurred in the procedure you were executing when the program halted.
