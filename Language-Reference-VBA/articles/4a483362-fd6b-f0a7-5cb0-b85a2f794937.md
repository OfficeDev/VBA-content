# Making Faster For...Next Loops

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Integers use less memory than the  [Variant data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and are slightly faster to update. However, this difference is only noticeable if you perform many thousands of operations. For example:



```
Dim CountFaster As Integer    ' First case, use Integer. 
For CountFaster = 0 to 32766     
Next CountFaster 
 
Dim CountSlower As Variant    ' Second case, use Variant. 
For CountSlower = 0 to 32766 
Next CountSlower 

```

The first case above takes slightly less time to run than the second case. However, if  `CountFaster` exceeds 32,767, an error occurs. To fix this, you can change `CountFaster` to the [Long data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), which accepts a wider range of integers. In general, the smaller the  [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the less time it takes to update. Variants are slightly slower than their equivalent data type.
