# Compiler Constants

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Visual Basic for Applications defines  [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for exclusive use with the **#If...Then...#Else** directive. These constants are functionally equivalent to constants defined with the **#If...Then...#Else** directive except that they are global in [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); that is, they apply everywhere in a  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

 **Note**  Because  **Win32** returns true in both 32-bit and 64-bit development platforms it is important that the order within the **#If...Then...#Else** directive returns the desired results in your code. For example, because **Win32** returns True in 64-bit ( **Win32** is compatible in **Win64** environments) checking for **Win32** before **Win64** results in the **Win64** condition never running because **Win32** returns True. The following order returns predictable results:




```
#If Win64 Then 
' Win64=true, Win32=true, Win16= false 
#ElseIf Win32 Then 
' Win32=true, Win16=false 
#Else 
' Win16=true 
#End If
```

This applies to both Winx and VBAx constants.
On 16-bit development platforms, the compiler constants are defined as follows:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Win16**| **True**|Indicates development environment is 16-bit compatible.|
| **Win32**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not 32-bit compatible.|
| **Win64**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not 64-bit compatible.|
On 32-bit development platforms, the compiler constants are defined as follows:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Vba6**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is Visual Basic for Applications, version 6.0 compatible.|
| **Vba6**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not Visual Basic for Applications, version 6.0 compatible.|
| **Vba7**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is Visual Basic for Applications, version 7.0 compatible.|
| **Vba7**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not Visual Basic for Applications, version 7.0 compatible.|
| **Win16**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not 16-bit compatible.|
| **Win32**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is 32-bit compatible.|
| **Win64**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not 64-bit compatible.|
| **Mac**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is Macintosh.|
| **Mac**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not Macintosh.|
On 64-bit development platforms, the compiler constants are defined as follows:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Vba6**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is Visual Basic for Applications, version 6.0 compatible.|
| **Vba6**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not Visual Basic for Applications, version 6.0 compatible.|
| **Vba7**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is Visual Basic for Applications, version 7.0 compatible.|
| **Vba7**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not Visual Basic for Applications, version 7.0 compatible.|
| **Win16**| **False**|Indicates development environment is not 16-bit compatible.|
| **Win32**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is 32-bit compatible.|
| **Win64**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is 64-bit compatible.|
| **Mac**| **True**|Indicates that the development environment is Macintosh.|
| **Mac**| **False**|Indicates that the development environment is not Macintosh.|

 **Note**  These constants are provided by Visual Basic, so you cannot define your own constants with these same names at any level.
