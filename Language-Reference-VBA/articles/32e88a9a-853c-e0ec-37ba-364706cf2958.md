Automatically displays all of the declared variables in the current procedure and their values.

When the  **Locals** window is visible, it is automatically updated every time there is a change from Run to [Break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or you navigate in the stack display.
You can:


- Resize the column headers by dragging the border to the right or the left.
    
- Close the window by clicking the Close box. If the Close box is not visible, double-click the  **Title** bar to make the Close box visible, then click it.
