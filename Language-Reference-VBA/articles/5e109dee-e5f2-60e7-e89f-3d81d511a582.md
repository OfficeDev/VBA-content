# Invalid qualifier

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Qualifiers are used for disambiguation. This error has the following cause and solution:




- The qualifier does not identify a  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), object, or a  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) within the current [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Check the spelling of the qualifier. Make sure that the qualifying  [identifier](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is within the current scope. For example, a variable of user-defined type in a **Private** module is visible only within that module.
