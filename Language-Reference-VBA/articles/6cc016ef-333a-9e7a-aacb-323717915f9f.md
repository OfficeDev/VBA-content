Specifies the maximum number of characters a user can enter in a  **TextBox** or **ComboBox**.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **MaxLength** [= _Long_]
The  **MaxLength** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Long_|Optional. An integer indicating the allowable number of characters.|
 **Remarks**
Setting the  **MaxLength** property to 0 indicates there is no limit other than that created by memory constraints.
