# File already open (Error 55)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Sometimes a file must be closed before another  **Open** or other operation can occur. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- A sequential-output mode  **Open** statement was executed for a file that is already open. You must close a file opened for one type of sequential access before opening it for another. For example, you must close a file opened for **Input** before opening it for **Output**.
    
- A statement, for example,  **Kill**,  **SetAttr**, or  **Name**, refers to an open file. Close the file before executing the statement.
