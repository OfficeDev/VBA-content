# CommandBarEvents Object (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returned by the  **CommandBarEvents** property. The **CommandBarEvents** object triggers an event when a [control](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) on the command bar is clicked.
 **Remarks**
The  **CommandBarEvents** object is returned by the **CommandBarEvents** property of the **Events** object. The object that is returned has one event in its interface, the Click event. You can handle this event using the **WithEvents** object declaration.
