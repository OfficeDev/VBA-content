# ListBox styles

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can choose between two presentation styles for a  **ListBox**. Each style provides different ways for users to select items in the list.

If the style is  **Plain**, each item is on a separate row; the user selects an item by highlighting one or more rows.

If the style is  **Option**, an option button or check box appears at the beginning of each row. With this style, the user selects an item by clicking the option button or check box. Check boxes appear only when the  **MultiSelect** property is **True**.
