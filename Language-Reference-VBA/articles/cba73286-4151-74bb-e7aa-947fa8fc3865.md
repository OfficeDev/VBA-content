# Line 'item1': Can't create embedded object in 'item2'

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

An embedded object could not be created while loading a form, User Control, User Document, or Property Page from a text file. For example, you would get this error if you previously inserted a Microsoft Word document onto the form, and then removed Microsoft Word from your system. This message is written to the error log file.
