# FileName Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns the full path name of the project file or host document.
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Filename**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.
 **Remarks**
Projects have no name other than the file name.
The path name returned is always provided as an absolute path (for example, "c:\projects\myproject.vba"), even if it is shown as a relative path (such as "..\projects\myproject.vba").
