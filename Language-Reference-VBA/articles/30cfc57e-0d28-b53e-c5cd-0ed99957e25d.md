# Line Input # Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Reads a single line from an open sequential file and assigns it to a  [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

 **Syntax**

 **Line Input #**_filenumber_,  _varname_
The  **Line Input #** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _filenumber_|Required. Any valid  [file number](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| _varname_|Required. Valid  [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or **String** variable name.|
 **Remarks**
Data read with  **Line Input #** is usually written from a file with **Print #**.
The  **Line Input #** statement reads from a file one character at a time until it encounters a carriage return ( **Chr(**13 **)**) or carriage return-linefeed ( **Chr(**13 **)** + **Chr(**10 **)**) sequence. Carriage return-linefeed sequences are skipped rather than appended to the character string.

## Example

This example uses the  **Line Input #** statement to read a line from a sequential file and assign it to a variable. This example assumes that is a text file with a few lines of sample data.


```
Dim TextLine 
Open "TESTFILE" For Input As #1 ' Open file. 
Do While Not EOF(1) ' Loop until end of file. 
 Line Input #1, TextLine ' Read line into variable. 
 Debug.Print TextLine ' Print to the Immediate window. 
Loop 
Close #1 ' Close file. 

```
