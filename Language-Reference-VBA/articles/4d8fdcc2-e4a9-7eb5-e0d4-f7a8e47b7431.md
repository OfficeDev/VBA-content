# Variable not defined

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You use the  **Option Explicit** statement to protect your [modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from having undeclared [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and to eliminate the possibility of inadvertently creating new variables when typographical errors occur. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You used an  **Option Explicit** statement to require the explicit declaration of variables, but you used a variable without declaring it. Explicitly declare the variable, or change the spelling of the variable to match that of the intended variable.
