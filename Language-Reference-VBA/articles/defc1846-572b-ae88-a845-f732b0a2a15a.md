# MIRR Function

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns a  [Double](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the modified internal rate of return for a series of periodic cash flows (payments and receipts).
 **Syntax**
 **MIRR( _values_(),** **_finance_rate_**,  **_reinvest_rate_)**
The  **MIRR** function has these [named arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **_values_()**|Required.  [Array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of **Double** specifying cash flow values. The array must contain at least one negative value (a payment) and one positive value (a receipt).|
| **_finance_rate_**|Required.  **Double** specifying interest rate paid as the cost of financing.|
| **_reinvest_rate_**|Required.  **Double** specifying interest rate received on gains from cash reinvestment.|
 **Remarks**
The modified internal rate of return is the internal rate of return when payments and receipts are financed at different rates. The  **MIRR** function takes into account both the cost of the investment ( **_finance_rate_**) and the interest rate received on reinvestment of cash ( **_reinvest_rate_**).
The  **_finance_rate_** and **_reinvest_rate_** [arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are percentages expressed as decimal values. For example, 12 percent is expressed as 0.12.
The  **MIRR** function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence.

## Example

This example uses the  **MIRR** function to return the modified internal rate of return for a series of cash flows contained in the array `Values()`.  `LoanAPR` represents the financing interest, and `InvAPR` represents the interest rate received on reinvestment.


```
Dim LoanAPR, InvAPR, Fmt, RetRate, Msg
Static Values(5) As Double    ' Set up array.
LoanAPR = .1    ' Loan rate.
InvAPR = .12    ' Reinvestment rate.
Fmt = "#0.00"    ' Define money format.
Values(0) = -70000    ' Business start-up costs.
' Positive cash flows reflecting income for four successive years.
Values(1) = 22000 : Values(2) = 25000
Values(3) = 28000 : Values(4) = 31000
RetRate = MIRR(Values(), LoanAPR, InvAPR)    ' Calculate internal rate.
Msg = "The modified internal rate of return for these five cash flows is"
Msg = Msg &amp; Format(Abs(RetRate) * 100, Fmt) &amp; "%."
MsgBox Msg    ' Display internal return 
        ' rate.
```
