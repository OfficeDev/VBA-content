When you click the  **Replace All** button in the **Replace** dialog box, this message specifies the total number of replacements. This condition has the following cause and effect:




- During the search and replace operation, only one instance of the specified text was found, and the replacement was made. You can specify the region to be covered: a selection, a  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), a  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or a  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    If a region is selected, it is the default search region. If no region is selected, the current module is the default search region. To change the  [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of a search, select a different option in the **Replace** dialog box.
