# - Operator

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Used to find the difference between two numbers or to indicate the negative value of a  [numeric expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax 1**
 _result_**=**_number1-number2_
 **Syntax 2**
 **-**_number_
The  **-** operator syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _result_|Required; any numeric  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| _number_|Required; any numeric expression.|
| _number1_|Required; any numeric expression.|
| _number2_|Required; any numeric expression.|
 **Remarks**
In Syntax 1, the  **-** operator is the arithmetic subtraction operator used to find the difference between two numbers. In Syntax 2, the **-** operator is used as the unary negation operator to indicate the negative value of an expression.
The  [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of _result_ is usually the same as that of the most precise [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The order of precision, from least to most precise, is  [Byte](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Single](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Double](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [Currency](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and  [Decimal](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The following are exceptions to this order:


|**If**|**Then  _result_ is**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Subtraction involves a  **Single** and a **Long**,|converted to a  **Double**.|
|The data type of  _result_ is a **Long**,  **Single**, or  [Date](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to a  [iVariant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing a **Double**.|
|The data type of  _result_ is a **Byte** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to an  **Integer** variant.|
|The data type of  _result_ is an **Integer** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to a  **Long** variant.|
|Subtraction involves a  **Date** and any other data type,|a  **Date**.|
|Subtraction involves two  **Date** expressions,|a  **Double**.|
One or both expressions are  [Null](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) expressions, _result_ is **Null**. If an expression is  [Empty](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), it is treated as 0.

 **Note**  The order of precision used by addition and subtraction is not the same as the order of precision used by multiplication.


## Example

This example uses the  **-** operator to calculate the difference between two numbers.


```
Dim MyResult
MyResult = 4 - 2    ' Returns 2.
MyResult = 459.35 - 334.90    ' Returns 124.45.


```
