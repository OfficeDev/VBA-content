# CodePane Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns a  **CodePane** object. Read-only.
 **Remarks**
If a  [code pane](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) exists, it becomes the active code pane, and the window that contains it becomes the active window. If a code pane doesn't exist for the [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the  **CodePane** property creates one.
