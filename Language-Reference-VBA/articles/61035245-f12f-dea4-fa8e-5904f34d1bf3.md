# Continue Code Execution

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

When you run your code, execution may stop if:




- An untrapped  [run-time error](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) occurs.
    
- A trapped run-time error occurs, and  **Break on All Errors** is selected on the **General** tab of the **Options** dialog box ( **Tools** menu).
    
- A previously set  [breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is encountered.
    
- A  **Stop** statement in your code is encountered, switching the mode to [break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
- An  **End** statement in your code is encountered, switching the mode to [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
- You halt execution manually at a given point.
    
- A  [watch expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), which you set to break when the value has changed or break when the value is true, is encountered.
