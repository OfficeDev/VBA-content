# 'Item' is a binary form and can't be loaded into Visual Basic

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Binary forms created with earlier versions of Visual Basic can't be loaded into this version of Visual Basic. Only Visual Basic versions 2.0 and 3.0 support converting binary forms to ASCII. If you have a copy of Visual Basic 2.0 or 3.0, you can load the form created with version 1.0 and those versions and save it as text. Then you can import the form in Visual Basic.
