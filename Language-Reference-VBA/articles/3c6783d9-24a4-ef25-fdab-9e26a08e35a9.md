# Division by zero (Error 11)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Division by zero isn't possible. This error has the following cause and solution:




- The value of an  [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) being used as a divisor is zero.
    
    Check the spelling of  [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero. Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as [arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from other procedures.
