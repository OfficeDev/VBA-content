# TabStrip Control

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Presents a set of related controls as a visual group.
 **Remarks**
You can use a  **TabStrip** to view different sets of information for related controls.
For example, the controls might represent information about a daily schedule for a group of individuals, with each set of information corresponding to a different individual in the group. Set the title of each tab to show one individual's name. Then, you can write code that, when you click a tab, updates the controls to show information about the person identified on the tab.

 **Note**  The  **TabStrip** is implemented as a [container](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of a **Tabs** collection, which in turn contains a group of **Tab** objects.

The default property for a  **TabStrip** is the **SelectedItem** property.
The default event for a  **TabStrip** is the Change event.
