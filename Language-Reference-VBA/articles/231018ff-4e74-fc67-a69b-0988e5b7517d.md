# Property Object (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents the  [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of an object that are visible in the [Properties window](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for any given component.
 **Remarks**
Use  **Value** property of the **Property** object to return or set the value of a property of a component.
At a minimum, all components have a  **Name** property. Use the **Value** property of the **Property** object to return or set the value of a property. The **Value** property returns a [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the appropriate type. If the value returned is an object, the **Value** property returns the **Properties** collection that contains **Property** objects representing the individual properties of the object. You can access each of the **Property** objects by using the **Item** method on the returned **Properties** collection.
If the value returned by the  **Property** object is an object, you can use the **Object** property to set the **Property** object to a new object.
