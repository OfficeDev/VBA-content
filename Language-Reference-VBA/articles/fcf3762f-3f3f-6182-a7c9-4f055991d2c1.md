# Array already dimensioned

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A static  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can only be dimensioned once. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You attempted to change the dimensions of a static array with a  **ReDim** statement; only dynamic arrays can be redimensioned. Either remove the redimensioning or use a dynamic array. To define a dynamic array, use a **Dim**,  **Public**,  **Private**, or  **Static** statement with empty parentheses. For example: `Dim MyArray()` In a [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), you can define a dynamic array with the  **ReDim** or **Static** statement using a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the number of elements:
    
  ```
  Dim MyArray() 

  ```


  ```
  ReDim MyArray(n) 

  ```


     In a [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), you can define a dynamic array with the  **ReDim** or **Static** statement using a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the number of elements: `ReDim MyArray(n)`
    
- An  **Option Base** statement occurs after array dimensions are set. Make sure any **Option Base** statement precedes all array declarations.
