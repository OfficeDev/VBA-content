# Update Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Refreshes the contents of the  **AddIns** collection from the add-ins listed in the Vbaddin.ini file in the same manner as if the user had opened the Add-In Manager dialog box.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Update**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.
 **Remarks**
All add-ins listed in the Vbaddin.ini file must be registered ActiveX components in the Registry before they can be used in Visual Basic.
