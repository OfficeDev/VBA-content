# Break Command (Run Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Stops execution of a program while it's running and switches to  [break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Any statement being executed when you choose this command is displayed in the  **Code** window with
![](../images/wbrkpnt_ZA01201808.gif) in the left margin if you checked Margin Indicator Bar in the **Editor** **Format** tab of the **Options** dialog box. If the application is waiting for events in the idle loop (no statement is being executed), no statement is highlighted until an event occurs.

Some editing changes made in break mode may require you to restart your program for the changes to take effect.
