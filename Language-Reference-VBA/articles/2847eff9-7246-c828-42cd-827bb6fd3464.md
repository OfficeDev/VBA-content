Use to delete or edit the context or type of a  [watch expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).



 **Important**  When selecting a context for a watch expression, use the narrowest  [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that fits your needs. Selecting all procedures or all modules could slow down execution considerably, since the expression is evaluated after execution of each statement. Selecting a specific procedure for a context affects execution only while the procedure is in the list of active procedure calls.



## Dialog Box Options

 **Expression**

Displays the selected expression by default. The expression is a variable, a property, a function call, or any other valid expression. You may enter a different expression to evaluate.

 **Context**

Sets the scope of the variables watched in the expression.




- Procedure â€” Displays the procedure name where the selected term resides (default). Defines the procedure(s) in which the expression is evaluated. You may select all procedures or a specific procedure context in which to evaluate the variable.
    
- Module â€” Displays the  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) name where the selected term resides (default). You may select all modules or a specific module context in which to evaluate the variable.
    
- Project â€” Displays the name of the current project. Expressions can't be evaluated in a context outside of the current project.
    


 **Watch Type**

Determines how Visual Basic responds to the watch expression.




- Watch Expression â€” Displays the watch expression and its value in the  **Watch** window. When you enter break mode, the value of the watch expression is automatically updated.
    
- Break When Value Is True â€” Execution automatically enters break mode when the expression evaluates to true or is any nonzero value (not valid for string expressions).
    
- Break When Value Changes â€” Execution automatically enters break mode when the value of expression changes within the specified context.
    


 **Delete**

Deletes the watch expression.
