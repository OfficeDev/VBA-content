 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns an object representing the code behind the component. Read-only.
 **Remarks**
The  **CodeModule** property returns **Nothing** if the component doesn't have a [code module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) associated with it.

 **Note**  The  **CodePane** object represents a visible code window. A given component can have several **CodePane** objects. The **CodeModule** object represents the code within a component. A component can only have one **CodeModule** object.
