# Only comments may appear after End Sub, End Function, or End Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Only  [comments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), directives, and  [declarations](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are permitted outside [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You placed executable code outside a procedure. Any nondeclarative lines outside a procedure must begin with a comment delimiter ( **'**). Declarative statements must appear before the first procedure declaration. Comments are ignored when the code executes.
