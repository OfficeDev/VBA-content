# Invalid procedure call or argument (Error 5)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Some part of the call can't be completed. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- An  [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) probably exceeds the range of permitted values. For example, the **Sin** function can only accept values within a certain range. Positive arguments less than 2,147,483,648 are accepted, while 2,147,483,648 generates this error.
    
    Check the ranges permitted for arguments.
    
- This error can also occur if an attempt is made to call a  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that isn't valid on the current platform. For example, some procedures may only be valid for Microsoft Windows, or for the Macintosh, and so on.
    
    Check platform-specific information about the procedure.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
