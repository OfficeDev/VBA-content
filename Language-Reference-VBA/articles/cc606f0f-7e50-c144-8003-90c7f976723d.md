# Can't assign to an array

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Each element of an  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) must have its value assigned individually. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You inadvertently tried to assign a single value to an array  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) without specifying the element to which the value should be assigned.
    
    
    
    To assign a single value to an array element, you must specify the element in a subscript. For example, if  `MyArray` is an integer array, the [expression ](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) ` MyArray = 5` is invalid, but the following expression is valid: `MyArray(UBound(MyArray)) = 5`
    
- You tried to assign a whole array to another array. 
    
    
    
    For example, if  `Arr1` is an array and `Arr2` is another array, the following two assignments are both invalid:
    


  ```
  Arr1 = Arr2    ' Invalid assignment. 
Arr1() = Arr2()    ' Invalid assignment. 

  ```


    To assign one array to another, make sure the array on the left-hand side of the assignment is resizable and the types of the array match.
    
     **Note**  You can place a whole array in a  **Variant**, resulting in a single variant variable containing the whole array:



  ```
  Dim MyArr As Variant 
MyVar = Arr2() 
  ```


    You then reference the elements of the array in the variant with the same subscript notation as for a normal array, for example:
    


  ```
  MyVar(3) = MyVar(1) + MyVar(5) 
  ```
