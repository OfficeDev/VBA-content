# Invalid picture type (Error 485)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The resource file picture format you tried to load doesn't match the specified property of the object. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You tried to use the  **LoadResPicture** method to load a bitmap resource as the **Icon** property of a form. Change the property to the **Picture** property or change the _format_ [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of **LoadResPicture** to **vbResIcon**.
    
- You tried to use the  **LoadResPicture** method to load a cursor resource as some property of an object or control other than the **MousePointer** property. Change the property reference to **MousePointer**.
