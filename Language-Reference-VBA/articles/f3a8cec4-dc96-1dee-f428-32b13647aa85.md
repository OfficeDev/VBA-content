# Rem Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Used to include explanatory remarks in a program.

 **Syntax**

 **Rem**_comment_
You can also use the following syntax:
 **'**_comment_
The optional  _comment_ [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is the text of any [comment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) you want to include. A space is required between the **Rem** [keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and _comment_.
 **Remarks**
If you use  [line numbers](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [line labels](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), you can branch from a  **GoTo** or **GoSub** [statement](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to a line containing a **Rem** statement. Execution continues with the first executable statement following the **Rem** statement. If the **Rem** keyword follows other statements on a line, it must be separated from the statements by a colon ( **:**).
You can use an apostrophe ( **'**) instead of the  **Rem** keyword. When you use an apostrophe, the colon is not required after other statements.

## Example

This example illustrates the various forms of the  **Rem** statement, which is used to include explanatory remarks in a program.


```
Dim MyStr1, MyStr2 
MyStr1 = "Hello": Rem Comment after a statement separated by a colon. 
MyStr2 = "Goodbye" ' This is also a comment; no colon is needed. 

```
