# ShowModal Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Sets a  **UserForm** to be modal or modeless in its display. Read-only at [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Remarks**
The settings for the  **ShowModal** property are:


|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **True**|(Default) The  **UserForm** is modal.|
| **False**|The  **UserForm** is modeless.|
 **Remarks**
When a  **UserForm** is modal, the user must supply information or close the **UserForm** before using any other part of the application. No subsequent code is executed until the **UserForm** is hidden or unloaded. Although other forms in the application are disabled when a **UserForm** is displayed, other applications are not.
When the  **UserForm** is modeless, the user can view other forms or windows without closing the **UserForm**.
Modeless forms do not appear in the task bar and are not in the window tab order.

 **Note**  If you attempt to open a  **UserForm** that has a **ShowModal** property in Microsoft Office 97, you get a run-time error because Office 97 only displays modal **UserForms**. Office 97 ignores the  **ShowModal** property and displays the **UserForm** modally.
