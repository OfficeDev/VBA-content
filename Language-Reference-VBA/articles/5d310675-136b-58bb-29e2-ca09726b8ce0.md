# Calling Procedures with the Same Name

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can call a  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) located in any [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the same [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as the active module just as you would call a procedure in the active module. However, if two or more modules contain a procedure with the same name, you must specify a module name in the calling statement, as shown in the following example:



```
Sub Main() 
    Module1.MyProcedure 
End Sub 

```

If you give the same name to two different procedures in two different projects, you must specify a project name when you call that procedure. For example, the following procedure calls the  `Main` procedure in the `MyModule` module in the `MyProject.vbp` project.



```
Sub Main() 
    [MyProject.vbp].[MyModule].Main 
End Sub 

```


 **Note**  Different applications have different names for a project. For example, in Microsoft Access, a project is called a database (.mdb); in Microsoft Excel, it's called a workbook (.xls)


## Tips for Calling Procedures




- If you rename a module or project, be sure to change the module or project name wherever it appears in calling  [statements](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); otherwise, Visual Basic will not be able to find the called procedure. You can use the  **Replace** command on the **Edit** menu to find and replace text in a module.
    
- To avoid naming conflicts among referenced projects, give your procedures unique names so you can call a procedure without specifying a project or module.
