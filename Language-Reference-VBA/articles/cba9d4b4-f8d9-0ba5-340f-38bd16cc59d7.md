# Must close or hide topmost modal form first (Error 402)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The modal form you are trying to close or hide isn't on top of the  [z-order](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- Another modal form is higher in the z-order than the modal form you tried to close or hide. First use either the  **Unload** statement or the **Hide** method on any modal form higher in the z-order. A modal form is a form displayed by the **Show** method, with the _style_ argument set to 1 - **vbModal**.
