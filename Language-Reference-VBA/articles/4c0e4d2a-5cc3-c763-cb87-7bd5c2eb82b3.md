# Boolean Data Type

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 [Boolean variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are stored as 16-bit (2-byte) numbers, but they can only be **True** or **False**.  **Boolean** variables display as either `True` or `False` (when **Print** is used) or `#TRUE#` or or `False` (when **Print** is used) or `#TRUE#` or `#FALSE#` (when **Write #** is used). Use the [keywords ](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) **True** and **False** to assign one of the two states to **Boolean** variables.

When other  [numeric types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are converted to **Boolean** values, 0 becomes **False** and all other values become **True**. When  **Boolean** values are converted to other [data types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  **False** becomes 0 and **True** becomes -1.
