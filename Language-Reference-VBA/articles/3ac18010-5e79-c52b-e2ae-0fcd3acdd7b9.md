# Tab Object

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


A  **Tab** is an individual member of a **Tabs** collection.
 **Remarks**
Visually, a  **Tab** object appears as a rectangle protruding from a larger rectangular area or as a button adjacent to a rectangular area.
In contrast to a  **Page**, a  **Tab** does not contain any controls. Controls that appear within the region bounded by a **TabStrip** are contained on the form, as is the **TabStrip**.
Each  **Tab** has its own set of properties, but has no methods or events. You must use events from the appropriate **TabStrip** to initiate processing of an individual **Tab**.
Each  **Tab** has a unique name and index value within the [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). You can reference a  **Tab** by either its name or its index value. The index of the first **Tab** is 0; the index of the second **Tab** is 1; and so on. When two **Tab** objects have the same name, you must reference each **Tab** by its index value. References to the name in code will access only the first **Tab** that uses the name.
