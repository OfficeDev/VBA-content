# Things you can do with a picture on an Image control

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

An  **Image** control is not a picture itself; rather, it contains a picture that is stored in a separate file. You cannot edit the picture with the properties of the **Image**, but you can use them to specify the way the picture appears on the  **Image**.

An interesting application of  **Image** is that you can use it as a background picture for your application. To do this, make the **Image** the same size as the form. Then, you can place other controls on top of the background.
