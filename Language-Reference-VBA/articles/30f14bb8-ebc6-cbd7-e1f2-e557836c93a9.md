# Current module does not support Print method

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Not all  [methods](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are appropriate in all [modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You tried to use the  **Print** method on an object that can't display anything. For example, you can't use the **Print** method without qualification in a [standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Remove the reference to the  **Print** method, or qualify it with an appropriate object. For example, qualify it with the **Debug** object to display its arguments in the **Immediate** window during debugging.
    
- You tried to use the  **Line**,  **Circle**,  **PSet**, or  **Scale** method on an object that can't accept them. For example, they can't appear unqualified in a standard module or an Automation [class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
