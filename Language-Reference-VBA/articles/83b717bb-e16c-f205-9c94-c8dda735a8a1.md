# Type-declaration character not allowed

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

While using  [type-declaration characters](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is valid in Visual Basic, some [data types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (including **Byte**,  **Boolean**,  **Date**,  **Object**, and  **Variant**) have no associated type-declaration characters. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You tried to use a type-declaration character in the declaration of a  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that uses the **As** clause, for example, with **Dim**,  **Static**,  **Public**, and so on.
    
    Either remove the type-declaration character or remove the  **As** clause.
    
- You tried to use a  [type-declaration character](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in reference to a variable that was implicitly declared without a type-declaration character:
    
  ```
  MyVar = 20    ' Implicit declaration. 
MyVar% = 25    ' Generates an error. 

  ```


  ```
  Dim MyStr$  
MyStr = "Because it was explicitly declared, the $ is optional." 

  ```


    Either remove the type-declaration character or redeclare the original variable.
    
     **Note**  If an explicit variable declaration contains a type-declaration character, inclusion of the character is optional in later references. For example:
