 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  **MultiPage** is a control that contains a [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of one or more pages.

Each  **Page** of a **MultiPage** is a form that contains its own controls, and as such, can have a unique layout. Typically, the pages in a **MultiPage** have tabs so the user can select the individual pages.

By default, a  **MultiPage** includes two pages, called Page1 and Page2. Each of these is a **Page** object, and together they represent the **Pages** collection of the **MultiPage**. If you add more pages, they become part of the same  **Pages** collection.
