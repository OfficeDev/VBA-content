 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

In your  **Open** statement, you specified a type of access that was invalid for the specified file type. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You attempted to open a file for  **Input**, but specified an illegal access mode. You can omit the access mode specification when opening a file for input, but if you specify it, the access mode must be  **Read**. Both  **Write** and **Read Write** are invalid access modes on a file opened for **Input**.
    
- You attempted to open a file for  **Append**, but specified an invalid access mode. You can omit the access mode specification when opening a file for append, but if you specify it, the access mode must be  **Write**. Both  **Read** and **Read Write** are invalid access modes on a file opened for **Append**.
    
- You attempted to open a file for  **Output**, but specified an invalid access mode. You can omit the access mode specification when opening a file for output, but if you specify it, the access mode must be  **Write**. Both  **Read** and **Read Write** are invalid access modes on a file opened for **Output**.
