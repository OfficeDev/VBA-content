# InsideHeight, InsideWidth Properties Example

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The following example uses the  **InsideHeight** and **InsideWidth** properties to resize a **CommandButton**. The user clicks the  **CommandButton** to resize it.

 **Note**   **InsideHeight** and **InsideWidth** are read-only properties.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains:


- A  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1.
    




```
Dim Resize As Single 
 
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 Resize = 0.75 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "Resize Button" 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 CommandButton1.Move 10, 10, _ 
 UserForm1.InsideWidth * Resize, _ 
 UserForm1.InsideHeight * Resize 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "Button resized " _ 
 &amp; "using InsideHeight and InsideWidth!" 
End Sub
```
