# Bad file mode (Error 54)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Statements used in manipulating file contents must be appropriate to the mode in which the file was opened. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- A  **Put** or **Get** statement is specifying a sequential file. **Put** and **Get** can only refer to files opened for **Random** or **Binary** access.
    
- A  **Print #** statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than **Output** or **Append**. Use a different statement to place data in the file or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.
    
- An  **Input #** statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than **Input**. Use a different statement to place data in the file or reopen the file in  **Input** mode.
    
- You attempted to write to a read-only file. Change the read/write status of the file or don't try to write to it.
