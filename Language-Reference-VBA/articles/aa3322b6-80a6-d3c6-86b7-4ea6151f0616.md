You can use  **Do...Loop** statements to run a block of [statements](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) an indefinite number of times. The statements are repeated either while a condition is **True** or until a condition becomes **True**.


## Repeating Statements While a Condition is True
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

There are two ways to use the  **While** [keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to check a condition in a **Do...Loop** statement. You can check the condition before you enter the loop , or you can check it after the loop has run at least once.

In the following  `ChkFirstWhile` procedure, you check the condition before you enter the loop. If `myNum` is set to 9 instead of 20, the statements inside the loop will never run. In the `ChkLastWhile` procedure, the statements inside the loop run only once before the condition becomes **False**.




```
Sub ChkFirstWhile() 
    counter = 0 
    myNum = 20 
    Do While myNum > 10 
        myNum = myNum - 1 
        counter = counter + 1 
    Loop 
    MsgBox "The loop made " &amp; counter &amp; " repetitions." 
End Sub 
 
Sub ChkLastWhile() 
    counter = 0 
    myNum = 9 
    Do 
        myNum = myNum - 1 
        counter = counter + 1 
    Loop While myNum > 10 
    MsgBox "The loop made " &amp; counter &amp; " repetitions." 
End Sub 

```


## Repeating Statements Until a Condition Becomes True
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

There are two ways to use the  **Until** keyword to check a condition in a **Do...Loop** statement. You can check the condition before you enter the loop (as shown in the `ChkFirstUntil` procedure), or you can check it after the loop has run at least once (as shown in the `ChkLastUntil` procedure). Looping continues while the condition remains **False**.


```
Sub ChkFirstUntil() 
    counter = 0 
    myNum = 20 
    Do Until myNum = 10 
        myNum = myNum - 1 
        counter = counter + 1 
    Loop 
    MsgBox "The loop made " &amp; counter &amp; " repetitions." 
End Sub 
 
Sub ChkLastUntil() 
    counter = 0 
    myNum = 1 
    Do 
        myNum = myNum + 1 
        counter = counter + 1 
    Loop Until myNum = 10 
    MsgBox "The loop made " &amp; counter &amp; " repetitions." 
End Sub 

```


## Exiting a Do...Loop Statement from Inside the Loop
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

You can exit a  **Do...Loop** using the **Exit Do** statement. For example, to exit an endless loop, use the **Exit Do** statement in the **True** statement block of either an **If...Then...Else** statement or a **Select Case** statement. If the condition is **False**, the loop will run as usual.

In the following example,  `myNum` is assigned a value that creates an endless loop. The **If...Then...Else** statement checks for this condition, and then exits, preventing endless looping.




```
Sub ExitExample() 
    counter = 0 
    myNum = 9 
    Do Until myNum = 10 
        myNum = myNum - 1 
        counter = counter + 1 
        If myNum < 10 Then Exit Do 
    Loop 
    MsgBox "The loop made " &amp; counter &amp; " repetitions." 
End Sub 

```


 **Note**  To stop an endless loop, press ESC or CTRL+BREAK.
