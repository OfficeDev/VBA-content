# Input Function

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns  [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing characters from a file opened in **Input** or **Binary** mode.
 **Syntax**
 **Input(**_number_, [ **#**] _filenumber_)
The  **Input** function syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _number_|Required. Any valid  [numeric expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the number of characters to return.|
| _filenumber_|Required. Any valid  [file number](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
 **Remarks**
Data read with the  **Input** function is usually written to a file with **Print #** or **Put**. Use this function only with files opened in  **Input** or **Binary** mode.
Unlike the  **Input #** statement, the **Input** function returns all of the characters it reads, including commas, carriage returns, linefeeds, quotation marks, and leading spaces.
With files opened for  **Binary** access, an attempt to read through the file using the **Input** function until **EOF** returns **True** generates an error. Use the **LOF** and **Loc** functions instead of **EOF** when reading binary files with **Input**, or use  **Get** when using the **EOF** function.

 **Note**  Use the  **InputB** function for byte data contained within text files. With **InputB**,  _number_ specifies the number of bytes to return rather than the number of characters to return.


## Example

This example uses the  **Input** function to read one character at a time from a file and print it to the **Immediate** window. This example assumes that `TESTFILE` is a text file with a few lines of sample data.


```
Dim MyChar
Open "TESTFILE" For Input As #1    ' Open file.
Do While Not EOF(1)    ' Loop until end of file.
    MyChar = Input(1, #1)    ' Get one character.
    Debug.Print MyChar    ' Print to the Immediate window.
Loop
Close #1    ' Close file.


```
