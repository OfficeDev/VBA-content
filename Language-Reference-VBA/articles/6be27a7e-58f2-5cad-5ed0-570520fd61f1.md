# Copy, GetFromClipboard, GetText Methods, DataObject Object Example

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The following example demonstrates data movement from a  **TextBox** to the Clipboard, from the Clipboard to a **DataObject**, and from a  **DataObject** into another **TextBox**. The  **GetFromClipboard** method transfers the data from the Clipboard to a **DataObject**. The  **Copy** and **GetText** methods are also used.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains:



- Two  **TextBox** controls named TextBox1 and TextBox2.
    
- A  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1.
    




```
Dim MyData as DataObject 
 
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 'Need to select text before copying it to Clipboard 
 TextBox1.SelStart = 0 
 TextBox1.SelLength = TextBox1.TextLength 
 TextBox1.Copy 
 
 MyData.GetFromClipboard 
 TextBox2.Text = MyData.GetText(1) 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 Set MyData = New DataObject 
 TextBox1.Text = "Move this data to the " _ 
 &amp; "Clipboard, to a DataObject, then to " 
 &amp; "TextBox2!" 
End Sub 
```
