# IsNull Function

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns a  **Boolean** value that indicates whether an [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) contains no valid data ( [Null](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)).
 **Syntax**
 **IsNull(**_expression_**)**
The required  _expression_ [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is a [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing a [numeric expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Remarks**
 **IsNull** returns **True** if _expression_ is **Null**; otherwise,  **IsNull** returns **False**. If  _expression_ consists of more than one [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  **Null** in any constituent variable causes **True** to be returned for the entire expression.
The  **Null** value indicates that the **Variant** contains no valid data. **Null** is not the same as [Empty](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), which indicates that a variable has not yet been initialized. It is also not the same as a zero-length string (""), which is sometimes referred to as a null string.


 **Important**  Use the  **IsNull** function to determine whether an expression contains a **Null** value. Expressions that you might expect to evaluate to **True** under some circumstances, such as `If Var = Null` and `If Var <> Null`, are always  **False**. This is because any expression containing a  **Null** is itself **Null** and, therefore, **False**.



## Example

This example uses the  **IsNull** function to determine if a variable contains a **Null**.


```
Dim MyVar, MyCheck
MyCheck = IsNull(MyVar)    ' Returns False.

MyVar = ""
MyCheck = IsNull(MyVar)    ' Returns False.

MyVar = Null
MyCheck = IsNull(MyVar)    ' Returns True.


```
