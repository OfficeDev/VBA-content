For MultiPage **Private Sub**_object__**Zoom(**_index_**As Long**,  _Percent_**As Integer)**
The  **Zoom** event syntax has these parts:

| _object_|Required. A valid object name.|
| _index_|Required. The index of the page in a  **MultiPage** associated with this event.|
| _Percent_|Required. The percentage the form is to be zoomed. Valid values range from 10 percent to 400 percent.|
 **Remarks**
The value of the  **Zoom** property identifies how the size of the form or **Page** changes. The value of the property indicates how the size of the control should change relative to its current size. Values less than 100 reduce the displayed size of the form; values greater than 100 increase the displayed size of the form.
You can set this property to any integer from 10 to 400.
