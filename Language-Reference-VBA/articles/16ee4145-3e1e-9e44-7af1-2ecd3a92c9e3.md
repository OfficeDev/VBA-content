 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Removes a member from a  [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); or, removes a control from a  **Frame**,  **Page**, or form.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Remove(**_collectionindex_**)**
The  **Remove** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _collectionindex_|Required. A member's position, or index, within a collection. Numeric as well as string values are acceptable. If the value is a number, the minimum value is zero, and the maximum value is one less than the number of members in the collection. If the value is a string, it must correspond to a valid member name.|
 **Remarks**
This method deletes any control that was added at  [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). However, attempting to delete a control that was added at  [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) will result in an error.
