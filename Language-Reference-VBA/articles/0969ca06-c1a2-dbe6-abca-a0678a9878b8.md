# Visual Basic Menus

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Visual Basic has two types of menus, built-in and shortcut.

## Built-in Menus

Built-in menus appear on the menu bar across the top of the Visual Basic window. Each menu contains commands that relate to the menu name. For example, the  **Format** menu contains commands used for formatting your form. Some of the commands have submenus that contains more specific commands. For example, the **Toolbars** command on the **View** menu has a submenu that contains the names of the toolbars and the **Customize** command. You can use the **Customize** command to modify the built-in menus or to add commands to the menu bar.


## Shortcut Menus

Shortcut menus are menus containing frequently used commands that appear when you click the right mouse button or press SHIFT+F10.


 **Note**  To find information on a command on a menu, use the  **Search Reference Index** command on the **Help** menu and search for the name of the command.
