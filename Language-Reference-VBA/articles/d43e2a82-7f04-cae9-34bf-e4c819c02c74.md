# Statements or labels invalid between Select Case and first Case

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can place nothing but a  [comment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) between the **Select Case** statement and the first **Case** clause. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You placed a statement between  **Select Case** and its first **Case** clause. For example:
    
  ```
  Select Case SomeVar 
' This is a comment and is valid. 
Stop ' Even a Stop statement is invalid here. 
Case SomeValue 
. . . 
End Select 

  ```


    The  **Select Case** statement must be immediately followed by its first **Case** statement. If the intervening [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is a comment, precede it with a comment delimiter ( **'**). Otherwise, place the expression where it belongs or delete it.
