# Undo and Redo in Microsoft Forms

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Microsoft Forms supports multiple levels of  **Undo** and **Redo** commands. This means you can undo a series of actions, not just a single action.

CTRL+Z is the shortcut key for  **Undo**; CTRL+Y is the shortcut key for  **Redo**.

You cannot undo or redo layering commands, such as  **Send To Back** or **Bring To Front**. For example, if you select an object and click  **Move Backward** on the shortcut menu, you will not be able to undo or redo that action.
