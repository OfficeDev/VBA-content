# Illegal parameter. Can't write arrays (Error 328)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

An illegal  [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) was passed to the method. This error has the following cause and solution:




- In the  **WriteProperties** event of your User Control, you tried to do a **PropBag.WriteProperty** X, where X is an [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This isn't supported.
    
    You must write out each element of the array individually.
