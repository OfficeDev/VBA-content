# End Select without Select Case

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **End Select** must be matched with a preceding **Select Case**. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You used an  **End Select** statement without a corresponding **Select Case** statement. This is usually due to an extra **End Select** below a **Select Case** block, or leaving behind the **End Select** statement when copying a **Select Case** block from one [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to another. Check each **End Select** statement to make sure it terminates a **Select Case** structure.
