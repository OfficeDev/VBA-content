# Resume without error (Error 20)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  **Resume** statement can only appear within an error handler and can only be executed in an active error handler. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You placed a  **Resume** statement outside error-handling code. Move the statement into an error handler, or delete it.
    
- Your code jumped into an error handler even though there was no error. Perhaps you misspelled a  [line label](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Jumps to labels can't occur across  [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), so search the procedure for the label that identifies the error handler. If you find a duplicate label specified as the target of a  **GoTo** statement that isn't an **On Error GoTo** statement, change the line label to agree with its intended target.
