# Select Constant Command (Edit Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Opens a dropdown list box in the  **Code** window that contains the valid constants for a property that you typed, and that preceded the equal sign (=). The **List** **Constants** command also works for functions with arguments that are constants. To have the list box automatically open as you type your code, select Auto List Members on the **Editor** tab in the **Options** dialog box.

You can find the constant you want by:



- Typing the name.
    
- Using the up and down arrow keys to move up and down in the list.
    
- Scrolling through the list and selecting the constant you want.
    

You can insert the constant into your code statement by:


- Double-clicking the constant.
    
- Selecting the constant and pressing TAB to insert the selection or pressing ENTER to insert the selection and move to the next line.
