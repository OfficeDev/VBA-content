# RSet allowed only on strings

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **RSet** is used to right align string data within fixed-length or variable-length strings. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to use the  **RSet** statement on a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that isn't a string.
    
    If appropriate, try converting the variable to a string. Otherwise, don't use  **RSet**.
    
     **Note**  Although the  **LSet** statement can be used to assign the elements of one [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) variable to the elements of a different, but compatible, user-defined type, such assignments are discouraged because they can't be guaranteed to be portable.
