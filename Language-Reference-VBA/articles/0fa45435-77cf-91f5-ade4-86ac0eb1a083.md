# GoTo Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Branches unconditionally to a specified line within a  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

 **Syntax**

 **GoTo**_line_
The required  _line_ [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can be any [line label](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [line number](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Remarks**
 **GoTo** can branch only to lines within the procedure where it appears.

 **Note**  Too many  **GoTo** statements can make code difficult to read and debug. Use structured control [statements](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) ( **Do...Loop**,  **For...Next**,  **If...Then...Else**,  **Select Case**) whenever possible.


## Example

This example uses the  **GoTo** statement to branch to line labels within a procedure.


```
Sub GotoStatementDemo() 
Dim Number, MyString 
 Number = 1 ' Initialize variable. 
 ' Evaluate Number and branch to appropriate label. 
 If Number = 1 Then GoTo Line1 Else GoTo Line2 
 
Line1: 
 MyString = "Number equals 1" 
 GoTo LastLine ' Go to LastLine. 
Line2: 
 ' The following statement never gets executed. 
 MyString = "Number equals 2" 
LastLine: 
 Debug.Print MyString ' Print "Number equals 1" in 
 ' the Immediate window. 
End Sub 

```
