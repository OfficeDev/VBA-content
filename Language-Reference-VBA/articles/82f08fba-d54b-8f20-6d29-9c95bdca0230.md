# User interrupt occurred (Error 18)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The process of breaking execution is useful, but if left unhandled, it results in termination of the application. This error has the following cause and solution:




- A user pressed CTRL+BREAK or another interrupt key. In the  [development environment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), continue execution. To provide for the occurrence of this condition at  [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), handle the error in an appropriate way.
