# Automation object doesn't have a default value (Error 443)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

When you specify an object name without a  [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [method](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), Visual Basic assumes you are referencing the object's default  [member](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (property or method). However, not all objects expose a default member. This error has the following cause and solution:




- Visual Basic can't determine the default member for the specified object. Check the object's documentation and give an explicit specification for the property or method.
