# PrintForm Method

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Sends a bit-by-bit image of a  **UserForm** object to the printer.
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.PrintForm**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list. If _object_ is omitted, the **UserForm** with the [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is assumed to be _object_.
 **Remarks**
 **PrintForm** prints all visible objects and [bitmaps](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the **UserForm** object. **PrintForm** also prints graphics added to a **UserForm** object.
The printer used by  **PrintForm** is determined by the operating system's **Control Panel** settings.

## Example

In the following example, the client area of the form is printed when the user clicks the form.


```
' This is the click event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm1.PrintForm
End Sub


```
