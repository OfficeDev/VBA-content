 **Settings**
The setting for the  [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) you pass to the **ReferencesEvents** property is:


|**Argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _vbproject_|If  _vbproject_ points to **Nothing**, the object that is returned will supply events for the  **References** collections of all **VBProject** objects in the **VBProjects** collection.If  _vbproject_ points to a valid **VBProject** object, the object that is returned will supply events for only the **References** collection for that [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
 **Remarks**
The  **ReferencesEvents** property takes an argument and returns an [event source object](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The  **ReferencesEvents** object is the source for events that are triggered when references are added or removed.
