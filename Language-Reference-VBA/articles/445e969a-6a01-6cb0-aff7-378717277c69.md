Returns a string containing the name of the parent folder of the last component in a specified path.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **GetParentFolderName(**_path_**)**
The  **GetParentFolderName** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. Always the name of a  **FileSystemObject**.|
| _path_|Required. The path specification for the component whose parent folder name is to be returned.|
 **Remarks**
The  **GetParentFolderName** method returns a zero-length string ("") if there is no parent folder for the component specified in the _path_ argument.

 **Note**  The  **GetParentFolderName** method works only on the provided _path_ string. It does not attempt to resolve the path, nor does it check for the existence of the specified path.
