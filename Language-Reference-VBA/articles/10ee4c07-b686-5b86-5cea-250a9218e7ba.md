# LongPtr Data Type

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **LongPtr** ( [Long](41802b5f-1d45-f586-dddd-acb6cced581b.md) integer on 32-bit systems, [LongLong](731bd14c-4523-cb84-cc00-21730fa745a8.md) integer on 64-bit systems) variables are stored as signed 32-bit (4-byte) numbers ranging in value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit systems; and signed 64-bit (8-byte) numbers ranging in value from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on 64-bit systems.

 **Note**   [LongPtr](10ee4c07-b686-5b86-5cea-250a9218e7ba.md) is not a true data type because it transforms to a [Long](41802b5f-1d45-f586-dddd-acb6cced581b.md) in 32-bit environments, or a [LongLong](731bd14c-4523-cb84-cc00-21730fa745a8.md) in 64-bit environments. Using **LongPtr** enables writing portable code that can run in both 32-bit and 64-bit environments. Use **LongPtr** for pointers and handles.
