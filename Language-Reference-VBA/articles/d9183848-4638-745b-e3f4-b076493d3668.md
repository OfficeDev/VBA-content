# Accelerator Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Sets or retrieves the  [accelerator key](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) for a control.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Accelerator** [= _String_]
The  **Accelerator** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _String_|Optional. The character to use as the accelerator key.|
 **Remarks**
To designate an accelerator key, enter a single character for the  **Accelerator** property. You can set **Accelerator** in the control's property sheet or in code. If the value of this property contains more than one character, the first character in the string becomes the value of **Accelerator**.
When an accelerator key is used, there is no visual feedback (other than  [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)) to indicate that the control initiated the Click event. For example, if the accelerator key applies to a  **CommandButton**, the user will not see the button pressed in the interface. The button receives the focus, however, when the user presses the accelerator key.
If the accelerator applies to a  **Label**, the control following the  **Label** in the [tab order](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), rather than the  **Label** itself, receives the focus.
