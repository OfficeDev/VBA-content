# Can't execute immediate statements in design mode

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 [Design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is any time that your code isn't being executed, or is suspended and waiting to be continued. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to execute a statement in the  **Immediate** window, but your code isn't in a running mode. Start your code running, and then suspend program execution. You can then execute code in the **Immediate** window.
    

For additional information, place the cursor in the  **Immediate** window and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
