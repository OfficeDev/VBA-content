# Duplicate procedure name

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You defined (or are attempting to define) more than one version of a  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) with the same name. Rename one of the procedures. Ensure duplicate **Declare** statements for the same procedure have the same **Alias** clause.
