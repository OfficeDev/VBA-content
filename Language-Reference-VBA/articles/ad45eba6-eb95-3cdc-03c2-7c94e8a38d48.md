# Remove Method (Visual Basic for Applications)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Removes a  [member](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from a **Collection** object.
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Remove**_index_
The  **Remove** method syntax has the following object qualifier and part:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An  [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _index_|Required. An  [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that specifies the position of a member of the [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). If a  [numeric expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  _index_ must be a number from 1 to the value of the collection's **Count** [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). If a  [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  _index_ must correspond to the **_key_** [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specified when the member referred to was added to the collection.|
 **Remarks**
If the value provided as  _index_ doesn't match an existing member of the collection, an error occurs.

## Example

This example illustrates the use of the  **Remove** method to remove objects from a **Collection** object, `MyClasses`. This code removes the object whose index is 1 on each iteration of the loop.


```
Dim Num, MyClasses
For Num = 1 To MyClasses.Count    
    MyClasses.Remove 1    ' Remove the first object each time
            ' through the loop until there are 
            ' no objects left in the collection.
Next Num

```
