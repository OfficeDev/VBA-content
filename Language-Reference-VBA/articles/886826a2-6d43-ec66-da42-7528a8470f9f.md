# Named arguments not allowed

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 [Named arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't permitted in all situations. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- You tried to specify a named argument as an  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) index, for example:
    
  ```
  MyVar = MyArray(MyNamedArg := 1) 

  ```


    Use an ordinary  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or constant [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as an array index.
    
- You tried to specify a named argument with an object, for example:
    
  ```
  MyVar = MyObject(MyNamedArg := 1) 

  ```


     Use a variable or constant expression if the object requires an [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For example, if the default for an object is a  [method](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the object's name represents the default method. If it needs arguments, specify them positionally.
    
- You tried to specify a named argument with an external name:
    
  ```
  MyVar = [MyName](MyNamedArg := 1) 

  ```


     Use an ordinary variable or constant expression if the external name needs an argument.
    
- You tried to specify a named argument with a data member of an object, for example:
    
  ```
  MyVar = [MyObject].MyProperty(MyNamedArg := 1) 

  ```


     Use an ordinary variable or constant expression if the data member needs an argument.
