# For Each can only iterate over a collection object or an array

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **For Each** construct can only be used with [collections](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [arrays](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You specified an object that isn't a collection or array as the  _group_ part of the **For Each** syntax. Check the spelling of the item over which you want to iterate to make sure it corresponds to a collection or array in [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in this part of your code.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
