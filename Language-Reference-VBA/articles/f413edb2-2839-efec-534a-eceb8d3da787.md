 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **PtrSafe** keyword is used in this context:

 [Declare Statement](82f68f6b-76c6-2efd-72d2-652000b3a083.md)


 **Note**  Declare statements with the  **PtrSafe** keyword is the recommended syntax. Declare statements that include **PtrSafe** work correctly in the VBA7 development environment on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms only after all data types in the **Declare** statement (parameters and return values) that need to store 64-bit quantities are updated to use [LongLong](731bd14c-4523-cb84-cc00-21730fa745a8.md) for 64-bit integrals or [LongPtr](10ee4c07-b686-5b86-5cea-250a9218e7ba.md) for pointers and handles. To ensure backwards compatibility with VBA version 6 and earlier use the following construct:




```
#If Vba7 Then 
Declare PtrSafe Sub... 
#Else 
Declare Sub... 
#EndIf
```

When running in 64-bit versions of Office  **Declare** statements must include the **PtrSafe** keyword.
The  **PtrSafe** keyword asserts that a **Declare** statement is safe to run in 64-bit development environments.
Adding the  **PtrSafe** keyword to a **Declare** statement only signifies the **Declare** statement explicitly targets 64-bits, all data types within the statement that need to store 64-bits (including return values and parameters) must still be modified to hold 64-bit quantities using either [LongLong](731bd14c-4523-cb84-cc00-21730fa745a8.md) for 64-bit integrals or [LongPtr](10ee4c07-b686-5b86-5cea-250a9218e7ba.md) for pointers and handles.
