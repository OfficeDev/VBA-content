 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Some attributes are invalid within  [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- A  **Public** or **Private** attribute appears within the body of a procedure definition. Remove the attribute from the procedure. To give the [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) wider [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), move the declaration to  [module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Variables declared within procedures are always  **Private**.
