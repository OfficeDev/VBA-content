# Assign an accelerator key for a Page or Tab

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015



1. In design mode, select an individual  **Page** or **Tab**. Be sure to select the  **Page** or **Tab**, not the associated  **MultiPage** or **TabStrip**. When a  **Page** or **Tab** is selected, a rectangle appears around the caption of the **Page** or **Tab**.
    
2. Right-click the selected  **Page** or **Tab**.
    
3. From the shortcut menu, choose  **Rename**.
    
4. In the  **Rename** dialog box, enter a single character in the **Accelerator Key** field.
    


 **Tip**  Use a character from the caption of the control. Note that the selected character is underlined in the control's caption.
