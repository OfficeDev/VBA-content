 _object_. **ListCount**
The  **ListCount** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|||
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
The  **ListCount** property is read-only. **ListCount** is the number of rows over which you can scroll. **ListRows** is the maximum to display at once. **ListCount** is always one greater than the largest value for the **ListIndex** property, because index numbers begin with 0 and the count of items begins with 1. If no item is selected, **ListCount** is 0 and **ListIndex** is -1.
