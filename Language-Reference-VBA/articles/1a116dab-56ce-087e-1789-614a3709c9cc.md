# DesignerWindow Method

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns the  **Window** object that represents the component's [designer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.DesignerWindow**
The  _object_ placeholder is an [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.
 **Remarks**
If the component supports a designer but doesn't have an open designer, using the  **DesignerWindow** method creates the designer, but it isn't visible. To make the window visible, set the **Window** object's **Visible** property to **True**.
