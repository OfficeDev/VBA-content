# Close Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Closes and destroys a window.
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Close**
The  _object_ placeholder is an [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.
 **Remarks**
The following types of windows respond to the  **Close** method in different ways:


- For a window that is a  [code pane](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  **Close** destroys the code pane.
    
- For a window that is a  [designer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  **Close** destroys the contained designer.
    
- For windows that are always available on the  **View** menu, **Close** hides the window.
