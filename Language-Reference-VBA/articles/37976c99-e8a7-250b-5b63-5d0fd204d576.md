# For Each may not be used on array of user-defined type or fixed-length strings

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **For Each** constructs are only valid for [collections](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [arrays](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of intrinsic types, including arrays of objects. Also, arrays of fixed-length strings can't be iterated using **For** **Each**. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- The elements of the array in your  **For Each** construct have a [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Use an ordinary  **For...Next** loop to iterate the elements of the array.
    
- The elements of the array in your  **For Each** construct have a fixed-length string type. Use an ordinary **For...Next** loop to iterate the elements of the array.
