# Assign a bitmap to a control

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

In the  **Properties** window:




1. Choose the  **Picture** property.
    
2. In the  **Picture** dialog box, enter the name of the picture and its location.
    

If the picture is larger than the control, Microsoft Forms scales the picture to fit the control, regardless of whether you assign the picture through the  **Properties** window or through code. The **PictureAlignment** property determines how it is aligned within the control.
