Not all  [object libraries](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [type libraries](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can be accessed by Visual Basic. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to use the  **Add References** dialog box to add a reference to a type library or object library that can't be used by Visual Basic. Check the documentation for the object represented by the library to see if it's available in some other form that Visual Basic can use.
