# Too many line continuations

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

There is a limit to the number of lines you can join with  [line-continuation characters](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- Your code has more than 25 physical lines lines joined with line-continuation characters, or more than 24 consecutive line-continuation characters in a single line. Make some of the constituent lines physically longer to reduce the number of line-continuation characters needed, or break the construct into more than one statement.
