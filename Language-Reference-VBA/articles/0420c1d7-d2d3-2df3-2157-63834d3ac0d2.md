- A  [line label](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [line number](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is referred to (for example in a **GoTo** statement), but doesn't occur within the [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the reference.
    
    The label must be within the  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that contains the reference. Line labels are visible only in their own procedures.
