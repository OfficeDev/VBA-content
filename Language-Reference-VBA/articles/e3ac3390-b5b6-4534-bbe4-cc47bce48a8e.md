# Invalid optional parameter type

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Not all Visual Basic types are permitted for  **Optional** parameters. This error has the following causes and solutions:


- A parameter is defined with an invalid data type. For example, you can't have an  **Optional** parameter of user-defined type. You may be able to accomplish your goal using an array of **Variant** type, since the elements of an array of **Variant** can store data of different types.
