When you create a native-code executable file, some extra programs must run. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- Memory or system resources were insufficient to run the code generator or linker. Close as many running applications as possible to free memory and other system resources.
    
- Visual Basic was installed incorrectly. Reinstall Visual Basic.
