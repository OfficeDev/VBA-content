# Range has no values

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

There are limitations on the way you can specify the number of elements in an  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You specified your array boundaries incorrectly. For example, the following ranges are invalid:
    
  ```
  Dim MyArray(10 To -5)    ' Descending order not permitted. 
Dim MyArray(0 To 0)        ' No elements in the array. 

  ```


    Check to be sure your syntax is correct. For example, the following range is valid:
    


  ```
  Dim MyArray(-5 To 10)
  ```
