# What is the Toolbox?

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The Toolbox identifies the different controls that you can add to a form,  **Frame**, or  **Page**.

You can customize the Toolbox in many ways including the following:



- Add pages to the Toolbox.
    
- Move controls from one page to another.
    
- Rename pages.
    
- Add other controls, including ActiveX controls, to the Toolbox.
    
- Copy customized controls from the form into the Toolbox.
    
- For example,  **OK** and **Cancel** buttons are special cases of a **CommandButton**. If you add  **OK** and **Cancel** templates to the Toolbox, you can quickly add them to other forms.
