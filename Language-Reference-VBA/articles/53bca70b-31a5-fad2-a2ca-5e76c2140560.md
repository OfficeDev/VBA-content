# Expected variable or procedure, not module

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

There is no  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name in the current [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but there is a  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name. This error has the following cause and solution:




- The name of a module is used as a variable or procedure. Check the spelling of the variable or procedure name, and make sure the name you want to refer to isn't private to another module. A module name can be a qualifier, but can't stand alone.
