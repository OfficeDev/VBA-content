Using conditional statements and looping statements (also called control structures), you can write Visual Basic code that makes decisions and repeats actions. Another useful control structure, the  **With** statement, lets you to run a series of statements without having to requalify an [object](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).


## Using Conditional Statements to Make Decisions
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

Conditional statements evaluate whether a condition is  **True** or **False**, and then specify one or more statements to run, depending on the result. Usually, a condition is an  [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that uses a [comparison operator](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to compare one value or [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) with another.

-  [If...Then...Else](5b138720-aad6-df90-305e-72adb644d7dd.md): Branching when a condition is  **True** or **False**
    
-  [Select Case](0573a361-84d6-549f-8c51-5bc0fe17d156.md): Selecting a branch from a set of conditions
    



## Using Loops to Repeat Code
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Looping allows you to run a group of statements repeatedly. Some loops repeat statements until a condition is  **False**; others repeat statements until a condition is  **True**. There are also loops that repeat statements a specific number of times or for each object in a  [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

-  [Do...Loop](aa3322b6-80a6-d3c6-86b7-4ea6151f0616.md): Looping while or until a condition is  **True**
    
-  [For...Next](fe6e66a7-a9d3-d363-65c5-00d35bb407bd.md): Using a counter to run statements a specified number of times
    
-  [For Each...Next](76df8944-219a-c28b-c449-39a3108c11be.md): Repeating a group of statements for each object in a collection
    



## Running Several Statements on the Same Object
<a name="sectionSection4"> </a>

In Visual Basic, usually you must specify an object before you can run one of its  [methods](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or change one of its [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). You can use the  **With** statement to specify an object once for an entire series of statements.
