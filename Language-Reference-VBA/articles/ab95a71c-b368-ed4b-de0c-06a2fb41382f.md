# This component doesn't raise any events

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

An event  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) must correspond to an event that can be raised by an object. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You wrote an event procedure for an object that doesn't raise events. You can't write an event procedure that doesn't correspond to an event.
    
- You tried to use  **WithEvents** on a [class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that doesn't raise events.
    
    You can't use  **WithEvents** on a class that doesn't raise events.
