# GroupName Property Example

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The following example uses the  **GroupName** property to create two groups of **OptionButton** controls on the same form.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains five  **OptionButton** controls named OptionButton1 through OptionButton5.




```
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 OptionButton1.GroupName = "Widgets" 
 OptionButton2.GroupName = "Widgets" 
 OptionButton4.GroupName = "Widgets" 
 
 OptionButton3.GroupName = "Gadgets-Group2" 
 OptionButton5.GroupName = "Gadgets-Group2" 
End Sub
```
