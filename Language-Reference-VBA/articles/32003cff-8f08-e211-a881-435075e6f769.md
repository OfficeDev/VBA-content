 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

On the  **View** menu, determine whether a check mark appears in front of **Toolbox**. If the check mark is present, the Toolbox is displayed. If not, the Toolbox is hidden.

Do one of the following:



- To display the Toolbox, make sure a check mark appears in front of  **Toolbox**. If not, select  **Toolbox**.
    
- To hide the Toolbox, make sure there is no check mark in front of  **Toolbox**. If there is, select  **Toolbox** to remove it.
