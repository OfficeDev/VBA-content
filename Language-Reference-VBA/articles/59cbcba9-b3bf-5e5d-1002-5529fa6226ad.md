# A procedure with a ParamArray argument cannot be called with named arguments

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

All  [arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in a call to a [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) defined with a **ParamArray** must be positional. This error has the following cause and solution:

-  [Named-argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) syntax appears in a procedure call.
    
    The named-argument calling syntax can't be used to call a procedure that includes a  **ParamArray** parameter. To supply only some elements of the **ParamArray**, use commas as placeholders for those elements you want to omit. For example, in the following call, if the  **ParamArray** arguments begin after `Arg2`, values are being passed only for the first, third, and sixth values in the  **ParamArray**:
    


  ```
  MySub Arg1, Arg2, 7,, 44,,,3 
  ```


     **Note**  The  **ParamArray** always represents the last items in the argument list.
For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
