 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Displays the  **Locals** window and automatically displays all of the [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the current stack and their values.

The  **Locals** window is automatically updated every time you change from [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to [break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and every time the stack context changes.
