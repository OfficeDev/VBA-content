# Create a Procedure

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Code within a  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is organized into [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). A procedure tells the application how to perform a specific task. Use procedures to divide complex code tasks into more manageable units.

 **To create a procedure by writing code**



1. Open the module for which you want to write the procedure.
    
2. You can create a  **Sub**,  **Function**, or  **Property** procedure.
    
3. Type  **Sub**,  **Function**, or  **Property**. Press F1 to get Help with syntax, if necessary.
    
4. Type code for the procedure. Visual Basic concludes the procedure with the appropriate  **End Sub**,  **End Function**, or  **End Property** statement.
    

 **To create a procedure using the Insert Procedure dialog box**


1. Open the module for which you want to write the procedure.
    
2. On the  **Insert** menu, click **Procedure**.
    
3. Type the name for the procedure in the  **Name** box of the **Insert Procedure** dialog box.
    
4. Select the type of procedure you want to create: Sub, Function, or Property.
    
5. Set the procedure's scope to either Public or Private.
    
6. You can select the  **All Local Variables as Statics** to add the **Static** [keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to the procedure definition.
    
7. Click  **OK**.
