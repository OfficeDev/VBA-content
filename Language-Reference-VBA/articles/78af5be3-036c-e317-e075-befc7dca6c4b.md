# Out of memory; some watches might have been deleted

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

When your system runs out of memory,  [watch expressions](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are deleted to make enough memory available to permit recovery from the condition. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You have too many  [applications](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [projects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or  [modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) loaded.
    
    To continue working, remove any dispensable elements from memory, including unnecessary applications, projects, or modules that may be loaded.
