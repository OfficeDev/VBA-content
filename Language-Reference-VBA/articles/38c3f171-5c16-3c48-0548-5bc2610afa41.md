# Too many arguments

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can have only 60 [arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You specified more than 60 arguments. If you must specify more arguments, define a  [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to collect multiple arguments of different types, or use a **ParamArray** as the final argument and pass multiple values to it. You can also pass multiple arguments by placing them in an [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
