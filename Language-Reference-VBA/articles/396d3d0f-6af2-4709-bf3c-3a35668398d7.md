# Return without GoSub (Error 3)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  **Return** statement must have a corresponding **GoSub** statement. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You have a  **Return** statement that can't be matched with a **GoSub** statement. Make sure your **GoSub** statement wasn't inadvertently deleted.
    

Unlike  **For...Next**,  **While...Wend**, and  **Sub...End Sub**, which are matched at  [compile time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  **GoSub** and **Return** are matched at [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
