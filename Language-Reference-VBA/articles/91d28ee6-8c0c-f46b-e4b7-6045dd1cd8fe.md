# For Each control variable on arrays must be Variant

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A control  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is the _element_ part of the **For Each...Next** statement syntax. This error has the following cause and solution:




- An  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) has a control variable that isn't a **Variant**.
    
    Make sure the  _group_ part of the **For Each...Next** is a **Variant** type variable.
