# TabStop Property Example

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The following example uses the  **TabStop** property to control whether a user can press TAB to move the focus to a particular control. The user presses TAB to move the focus among the controls on the form, and then clicks the **ToggleButton** to change **TabStop** for CommandButton1. When **TabStop** is **False**, CommandButton1 will not receive the focus by using TAB.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains:



- A  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1.
    
- A  **ToggleButton** named ToggleButton1.
    
- One or two other controls, such as an  **OptionButton** or **ListBox**.
    




```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 MsgBox "Clicked CommandButton1." 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub ToggleButton1_Click() 
 If ToggleButton1 = True Then 
 CommandButton1.TabStop = True 
 ToggleButton1.Caption = "TabStop On" 
 Else 
 CommandButton1.TabStop = False 
 ToggleButton1.Caption = "TabStop Off" 
 End If 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "Show Message" 
 
 ToggleButton1.Caption = "TabStop On" 
 ToggleButton1.Value = True 
 ToggleButton1.Width = 90 
End Sub
```
