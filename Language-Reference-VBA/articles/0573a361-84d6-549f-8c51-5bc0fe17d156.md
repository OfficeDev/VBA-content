# Using Select Case Statements

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Use the  **Select Case** statement as an alternative to using **ElseIf** in **If...Then...Else** statements when comparing one [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to several different values. While **If...Then...Else** statements can evaluate a different expression for each **ElseIf** statement, the **Select Case** statement evaluates an expression only once, at the top of the control structure.

In the following example, the  **Select Case** statement evaluates the argument that is passed to the procedure. Note that each **Case** statement can contain more than one value, a range of values, or a combination of values and [comparison operators](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The optional  **Case Else** statement runs if the **Select Case** statement doesn't match a value in any of the **Case** statements.




```
Function Bonus(performance, salary) 
 Select Case performance 
 Case 1 
 Bonus = salary * 0.1 
 Case 2, 3 
 Bonus = salary * 0.09 
 Case 4 To 6 
 Bonus = salary * 0.07 
 Case Is > 8 
 Bonus = 100 
 Case Else 
 Bonus = 0 
 End Select 
End Function 

```
