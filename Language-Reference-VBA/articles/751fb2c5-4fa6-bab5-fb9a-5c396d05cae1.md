# UndoAction Method

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Reverses the most recent action that supports the Undo command.
 **Syntax**
 _Boolean_ = _object_. **UndoAction**
The  **UndoAction** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
The Undo command in the user interface uses the  **UndoAction** method. For example, if you paste text into a **TextBox**, you can use  **UndoAction** to remove that text and restore the previous contents of the **TextBox**.
Not all user actions can be undone. If an action cannot be undone, the Undo command is unavailable following the action.

 **Note**  If the  **CanUndo** property is **False**, the Undo command is not available in the user interface, and  **UndoAction** is not valid in code.

If  **UndoAction** is applied to a form, all changes to the current record are lost. If **UndoAction** is applied to a control, only the control itself is affected.
You must apply this method before the form or control is updated. You may want to include this method in a form's BeforeUpdate event or a control's Change event.
 **UndoAction** is an alternative to using the [SendKeys Statement](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to send the value of ESC in an event procedure.
