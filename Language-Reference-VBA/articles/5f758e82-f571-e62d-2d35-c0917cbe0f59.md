# Windows Collection (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Contains all open or permanent windows.
 **Remarks**
Use the  **Windows** collection to access **Window** objects.
The  **Windows** collection has a fixed set of windows that are always available in the [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), such as the  [Project window](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the  [Properties window](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and a set of windows that represent all open code windows and  [designer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) windows. Opening a code or designer window adds a new member to the **Windows** collection. Closing a code or designer window removes a member from the **Windows** collection. Closing a permanent [development environment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) window doesn't remove the corresponding object from this collection, but results in the window not being visible.
