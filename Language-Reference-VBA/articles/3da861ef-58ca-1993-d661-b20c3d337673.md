# Should I use a MultiPage or a TabStrip?

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

If you use a single layout for data, use a  **TabStrip** and map each set of data to its own **Tab**. If you need several layouts for data, use a  **MultiPage** and assign each layout to its own **Page**.

Unlike a  **Page** of a **MultiPage**, the  [client region](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) of a **TabStrip** is not a separate form, but a portion of the form that contains the **TabStrip**. The border of a  **TabStrip** defines a region of the form that you can associate with the tabs. When you place a control in the client region of a **TabStrip**, you are adding a control to the form that contains the  **TabStrip**.
