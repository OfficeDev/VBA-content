# Start Code Execution

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

One way to test your code is to run it and work with it as a user would.

 **To start code execution**



- Choose  **Run Sub/UserForm** (F5) from the **Run** menu.
    

If your application doesn't run, it may be because:


- A  [syntax error](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or some other error exists in your code.
    
- A  [logic error](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) exists in your code, which may result in a [run-time error](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    

To get Help, click the  **Help** button or press F1 while the error message is displayed. Consider the suggestions provided to correct the error before you run your code again.
