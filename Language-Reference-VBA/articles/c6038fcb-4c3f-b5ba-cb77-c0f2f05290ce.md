 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Not all types of data can be assigned to  [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to declare the type of a constant to be a  [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), an object, or an  [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Remove the declaration or redeclare as a  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
