# Run Sub/UserForm, Continue, and Run Macro Commands (Run Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **Run Sub/UserForm**

Runs the current procedure if the cursor is in a procedure or runs the form if a form is currently active. This command becomes the  **Continue** command when you are in [break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

If neither  **Code** window nor **UserForm** is active, this command becomes the **Run Macro** command.
 **Continue**
Resumes running the current procedure or form.
 **Run Macro**
Runs the macro.
