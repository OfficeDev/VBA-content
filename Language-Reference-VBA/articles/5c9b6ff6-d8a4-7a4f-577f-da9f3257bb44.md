# Writing a Sub Procedure

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  **Sub** procedure is a series of Visual Basic [statements](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) enclosed by the **Sub** and **End Sub** statements that performs actions but doesn't return a value. A **Sub** procedure can take arguments, such as [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or  [expressions](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that are passed by a calling procedure. If a **Sub** procedure has no arguments, the **Sub** statement must include an empty set of parentheses.

The following  **Sub** procedure has comments explaining each line.




```
' Declares a procedure named GetInfo 
' This Sub procedure takes no arguments 
Sub GetInfo() 
' Declares a string variable named answer 
Dim answer As String 
' Assigns the return value of the InputBox function to answer 
answer = InputBox(Prompt:="What is your name?") 
 ' Conditional If...Then...Else statement 
 If answer = Empty Then 
 ' Calls the MsgBox function 
 MsgBox Prompt:="You did not enter a name." 
 Else 
 ' MsgBox function concatenated with the variable answer 
 MsgBox Prompt:="Your name is " &amp; answer 
 ' Ends the If...Then...Else statement 
 End If 
' Ends the Sub procedure 
End Sub 

```
