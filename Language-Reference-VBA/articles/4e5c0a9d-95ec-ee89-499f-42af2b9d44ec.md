# Set Next Statement can only apply to executable lines within current procedure.

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can choose the  **Set Next Statement** command to indicate where a suspended program should begin when execution is continued. This error has the following causes and solutions:




- When you chose the command, the cursor was on a line that didn't contain an executable statement. Place the cursor on a line with an executable statement and try again.  [Declarations](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [line labels](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and  [comments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't executable, so lines with only declarations, labels, and comments can't be the targets of the **Set Next Statement** command.
    
- When you chose the command, the cursor was on a line outside the currently executing  [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Place the cursor on a line within the currently executing procedure.
