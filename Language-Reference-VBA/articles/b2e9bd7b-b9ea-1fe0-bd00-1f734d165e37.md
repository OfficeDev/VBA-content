 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


 **Description**
Returns information about the type of a file or folder. For example, for files ending in .TXT, "Text Document" is returned.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Type**
The  _object_ is always a **File** or **Folder** object.
 **Remarks**
The following code illustrates the use of the  **Type** property to return a folder type. In this example, try providing the path of the Recycle Bin or other unique folder to the procedure.



```
Sub ShowFileSize(filespec)
    Dim fs, f, s
    Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set f = fs.GetFolder(filespec)
    s = UCase(f.Name) &amp; " is a " &amp; f.Type 
    MsgBox s, 0, "File Size Info"
End Sub

```
