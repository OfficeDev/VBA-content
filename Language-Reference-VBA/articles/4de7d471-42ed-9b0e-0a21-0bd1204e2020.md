# TextBox Control

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Displays information from a user or from an organized set of data.
 **Remarks**
A  **TextBox** is the control most commonly used to display information entered by a user. Also, it can display a set of data, such as a table, query, worksheet, or a calculation result. If a **TextBox** is [bound](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) to a [data source](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md), then changing the contents of the  **TextBox** also changes the value of the bound data source.
Formatting applied to any piece of text in a  **TextBox** will affect all text in the control. For example, if you change the font or point size of any character in the control, the change will affect all characters in the control.
The default property for a  **TextBox** is the **Value** property.
The default event for a  **TextBox** is the Change event.
