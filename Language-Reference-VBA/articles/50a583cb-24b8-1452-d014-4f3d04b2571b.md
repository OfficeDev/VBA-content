# Margin Indicators

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Visual Basic contains  [margin indicators](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that provide visual cues to certain actions during the editing of your code. If more than one action occurs on a line, the appropriate indicators also appear.

The margin indicators appear in the Margin Indicator bar on left side of the  **Code** window.

You can turn the Margin Indicator Bar on and off in the  **Editor** **Format** tab of the **Options** dialog box.

|Current line of execution|Indicates the line of code that will be executed next. You can drag this margin indicator to a new location within any running code module. If you drag the Current line of execution margin indicator to any non-valid region or line, nothing happens and the indicator returns to the original location.|
