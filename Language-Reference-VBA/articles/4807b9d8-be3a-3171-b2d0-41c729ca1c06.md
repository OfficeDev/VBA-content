# Last Position Command (View Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Allows you to quickly navigate to a previous location in your code. Enabled only if you edited code or made a  **Definition** command call and only when the **Code** window is displayed. Visual Basic only keeps track of the last 8 lines that were accessed or edited.

Keyboard shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+F2.
