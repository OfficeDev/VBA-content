# OldLeft, OldTop Properties

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns the distance, in  [points](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), between the previous position of a control and the left or top edge of the form that contains it.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **OldLeft**
 _object_. **OldTop**
The  **OldLeft** and **OldTop** property syntaxes have these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
 **OldLeft** and **OldTop** are read-only.
The  **OldLeft** and **OldTop** properties are automatically updated when you move or size a control. If you move a control, the **Left** and **Top** properties store the new distance from the control to the left edge of its [container](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and **OldLeft** and **OldTop** store the previous value of **Left**.
 **OldLeft** and **OldTop** are valid only in the Layout event.
