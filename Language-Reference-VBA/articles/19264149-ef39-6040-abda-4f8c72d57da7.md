# References Command (Tools Menu)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Displays the  **References** dialog box. This dialog box allows you to add an [object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) reference to your project. This makes another application's objects available in your code. Once a reference is set, the referenced objects are displayed in the [Object Browser](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

You can also add references to other loaded and saved projects. If a project has not been saved, it appears as "UNSAVED: <ProjectName>" and you will be unable to make a reference to it.

Only available at  [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
