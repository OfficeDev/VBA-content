# EnterFieldBehavior Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Specifies the selection behavior when entering a  **TextBox** or **ComboBox**.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **EnterFieldBehavior** [= _fmEnterFieldBehavior_]
The  **EnterFieldBehavior** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _fmEnterFieldBehavior_|Optional. The desired selection behavior.|
 **Settings**
The settings for  _fmEnterFieldBehavior_ are:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _fmEnterFieldBehaviorSelectAll_|0|Selects the entire contents of the edit region when entering the control (default).|
| _fmEnterFieldBehaviorRecallSelection_|1|Leaves the selection unchanged. Visually, this uses the selection that was in effect the last time the control was active.|
 **Remarks**
The  **EnterFieldBehavior** property controls the way text is selected when the user tabs to the control, not when the control receives [focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as a result of the **SetFocus** method. Following **SetFocus**, the contents of the control are not selected and the insertion point appears after the last character in the control's edit region.
