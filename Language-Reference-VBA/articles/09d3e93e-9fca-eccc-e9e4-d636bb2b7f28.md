# A module is not a valid type

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A  [standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) doesn't represent a [class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and can't be instantiated in the form of a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- You used the name of a standard module in a  **Dim** or **Set** declaration. Check the spelling of the module name and make sure it corresponds to a [form](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [MDI form](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or  [class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
