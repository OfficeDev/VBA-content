# Split the Code Window

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can split the  **Code** window horizontally into two panes to view different code segments of a [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) at the same time. Each pane scrolls separately, both horizontally and vertically. The [Procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and [Object box](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) options refer to the pane that has the focus. Code changes are immediately reflected in both panes.

 **To split the Code window into panes**



- Drag the split bar at the top of the vertical scroll bar down from the upper-right corner of the  **Code** window.
    

 **To remove a split from the Code window**


- Double-click the split bar or drag it to the top or bottom of the  **Code** window.
