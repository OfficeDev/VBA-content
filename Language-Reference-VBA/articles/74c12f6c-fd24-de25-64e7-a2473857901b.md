# Using the Add-In Manager

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Use the  **Add-In Manager** dialog box to load or unload an add-in. If you close only the visible portions of an add-in â€” by double-clicking its system menu or by clicking its close button, for example â€” its forms disappear from the screen, but the add-in is still present in memory. The add-in object itself will always stay resident in memory until the add-in is disconnected through the **Add-In Manager** dialog box.
