# Can't use character device names in file names: 'item' (Error 320)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

From within Visual Basic, you can't give a file the same name as a character device driver. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to use a file name such as AUX, CON, COM1, COM2, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, or NUL. Give the file another name.
