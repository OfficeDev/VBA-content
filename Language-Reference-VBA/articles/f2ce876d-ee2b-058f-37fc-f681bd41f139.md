# CodeModule Object (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents the code behind a component, such as a  [form](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  [class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or  [document](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Remarks**
You use the  **CodeModule** object to modify (add, delete, or edit) the code associated with a component.
Each component is associated with one  **CodeModule** object. However, a **CodeModule** object can be associated with multiple [code panes](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
The methods associated with the  **CodeModule** object enable you to manipulate and return information about the code text on a line-by-line basis. For example, you can use the **AddFromString** method to add text to the [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).  **AddFromString** places the text just above the first [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the module or places the text at the end of the module if there are no procedures.
Use the  **Parent** property to return the **VBComponent** object associated with a [code module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
