Visual Basic couldn't load the  [add-in](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that you tried to select from the **Available Add-Ins** list in the **Add-In Manager** dialog box, because it was not registered properly or is no longer registered in the system [registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
