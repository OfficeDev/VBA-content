# Arrange buttons

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015



1. Select the  **CommandButton** controls to arrange.
    
2. From the  **Format** menu, choose **Arrange Buttons**.
    
3. From the cascading menu, choose one of the following:
    
    
    
      -  **Bottom** â€” to put the buttons in a row starting at the bottom left corner of the form and align the bottoms of all buttons.
    
  -  **Right** â€” to put the buttons in a column starting at the upper right corner of the form and align the right edges of all buttons.
    

    
    

After you arrange the buttons, use either  **Horizontal Spacing** or **Vertical Spacing** on the **Format** menu to adjust the spacing between the buttons.

 **Tip**  Select a small grid size before choosing this command to position the buttons close to the bottom or right of the form. Changing the grid size after the buttons are in place will not change their position.
