# Cyclic reference of projects not allowed

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Circular references to  [projects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't allowed. For example, if `MyProj` references `YourProj`, then  `YourProj` (or a project that references `YourProj`) can't reference references  `YourProj`, then  `YourProj` (or a project that references `YourProj`) can't reference  `MyProj`. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to add a reference to a project that is already part of the project. Remove the circular reference or references.
