- Objects (within collections)
    

Each element of the Microsoft Forms object model has some combination of properties, events, and methods that you can use to make your application work the way you want it to.
Microsoft Forms has three collections:
 **Controls** collection â€” contains all the controls on a form, **Frame**, or  **Page**.
 **Pages** collection â€” contains all the **Page** objects in a **MultiPage**. Each  **MultiPage** has its own distinct **Pages** collection.
 **Tabs** collection â€” contains all the **Tab** objects in a **TabStrip**. Each  **TabStrip** has its own distinct **Tabs** collection.
