This error has the following causes:




- You loaded a form, User Control, User Document, or Property Page that contains objects with conflicting names. This can occur if the file was edited outside of Visual Basic.
    
- This error can occur when you rename a form to the same name as the  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), another form, or a  [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). It can also occur when you rename the project to the same name as a form or module.
