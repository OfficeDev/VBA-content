# DriveLetter Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


 **Description**
Returns the drive letter of a physical local drive or a network share. Read-only.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **DriveLetter**
The  _object_ is always a **Drive** object.
 **Remarks**
The  **DriveLetter** property returns a zero-length string ("") if the specified drive is not associated with a drive letter, for example, a network share that has not been mapped to a drive letter.
The following code illustrates the use of the  **DriveLetter** property:



```
Sub ShowDriveLetter(drvPath)
    Dim fs, d, s
    Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set d = fs.GetDrive(fs.GetDriveName(drvPath))
    s = "Drive " &amp; d.DriveLetter &amp; ": - " 
    s = s &amp; d.VolumeName  &amp; vbCrLf
    s = s &amp; "Free Space: " &amp; FormatNumber(d.FreeSpace/1024, 0) 
    s = s &amp; " Kbytes"
    MsgBox s
End Sub

```
