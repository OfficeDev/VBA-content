 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns a  [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the current read/write position within an open file.
 **Syntax**
 **Loc(**_filenumber_**)**
The required  _filenumber_ [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is any valid [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) [file number](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Remarks**
The following describes the return value for each file access mode:


|**Mode**|**Return Value**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Random**|Number of the last record read from or written to the file.|
| **Sequential**|Current byte position in the file divided by 128. However, information returned by  **Loc** for sequential files is neither used nor required.|
| **Binary**|Position of the last byte read or written.|

## Example

This example uses the  **Loc** function to return the current read/write position within an open file. This example assumes that `TESTFILE` is a text file with a few lines of sample data.


```
Dim MyLocation, MyLine
Open "TESTFILE" For Binary As #1    ' Open file just created.
Do While MyLocation < LOF(1)    ' Loop until end of file.
    MyLine = MyLine &amp; Input(1, #1)    ' Read character into variable.
    MyLocation = Loc(1)    ' Get current position within file.
' Print to the Immediate window.
    Debug.Print MyLine; Tab; MyLocation
Loop
Close #1    ' Close file.

```
