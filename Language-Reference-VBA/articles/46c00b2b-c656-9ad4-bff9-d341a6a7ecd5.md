# Invalid outside procedure

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The statement must occur within a  **Sub** or **Function**, or a property procedure ( **Property Get**,  **Property Let**,  **Property Set**). This error has the following cause and solution:




- An executable statement,  **Static** or **ReDim**, appears at  [module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
     **Static** is unnecessary at module level, since all module-level [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are static. Use **Dim** instead of **ReDim** at module level. To create a dynamic [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) at module level, declare it with **Dim** using empty parentheses.
    
     **Note**  At module level, you can use only  [comments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and declarative statements, such as **Const**,  **Declare**,  **Def**_type_,  **Dim**,  **Option Base**,  **Option Compare**,  **Option Explicit**,  **Option Private**,  **Private**,  **Public**, and  **Type**. The  **Sub**,  **Function**, and  **Property** statements occur outside the body of their [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but within the procedure declaration.
