# DeleteSetting Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Deletes a section or key setting from an application's entry in the Windows  [registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or (on the Macintosh) information in the application's initialization file.

 **Syntax**

 **DeleteSetting  _appname_,** **_section_**[ **,** **_key_**]
The  **DeleteSetting** statement syntax has these [named arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **_appname_**|Required.  [String expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing the name of the application or [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to which the section or key setting applies. On the Macintosh, this is the filename of the initialization file in the Preferences folder in the System folder.|
| **_section_**|Required. String expression containing the name of the section where the key setting is being deleted. If only  **_appname_** and **_section_** are provided, the specified section is deleted along with all related key settings.|
| **_key_**|Optional. String expression containing the name of the key setting being deleted.|
 **Remarks**
If all  [arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are provided, the specified setting is deleted. A run-time error occurs if you attempt to use the **DeleteSetting** statement on a non-existent section or key setting.

## Example

The following example first uses the  **SaveSetting** statement to make entries in the Windows registry (or .ini file on 16-bit Windows platforms) for the application, and then uses the **DeleteSetting** statement to remove them. Because no **_key_** argument is specified, the whole section is deleted, including the section name and all its keys.


```
' Place some settings in the registry. 
SaveSetting appname := "MyApp", section := "Startup", _ 
 key := "Top", setting := 75 
SaveSetting "MyApp","Startup", "Left", 50 
' Remove section and all its settings from registry. 
DeleteSetting "MyApp", "Startup"
```
