2. Use the  **General** tab in the **&lt;projectname> Properties** dialog box to specify the following:
    
    
    
      - Name of your project.
    
  - Description of your  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
  - Name of the Help file associated with your project.
    
  - Context ID for the specific Help topic to be called when the user clicks the  **Help** button while the application's [object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is selected in the **Object Browser**.
    

    
    
3. Use the  **Protection** tab in the **&lt;projectname> Properties** dialog box to lock the project from viewing by others and specify a password for access to project properties. After you set protection, you must save and close your project for the protection to take effect.
