# ControlTipText Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Specifies text that appears when the user briefly holds the mouse pointer over a control without clicking.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **ControlTipText** [= _String_]
The  **ControlTipText** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _String_|Optional. The text that appears when the user holds the mouse pointer over a control.|
 **Remarks**
The  **ControlTipText** property lets you give users tips about a control in a running form. The property can be set during [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) but only appears by the control during [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
The default value of  **ControlTipText** is an empty string. When the value of **ControlTipText** is set to an empty string, no tip is available for that control.
