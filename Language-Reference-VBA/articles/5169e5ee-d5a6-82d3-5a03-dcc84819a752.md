# AddFromFile Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


For the  **References** collection, adds a reference to a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from a file. For the **CodeModule** object, adds the contents of a file to a [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.AddFromFile(**_filename_**)**
The  **AddFromFile** syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An  [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _filename_|Required. A  [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the name of the file you want to add to the project or module. If the file name isn't found and a path name isn't specified, the directories searched by the **Windows OpenFile** function are searched.|
 **Remarks**
For the  **CodeModule** object, the **AddFromFile** method inserts the contents of the file starting on the line preceding the first [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the [code module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). If the module doesn't contain procedures,  **AddFromFile** places the contents of the file at the end of the module.
