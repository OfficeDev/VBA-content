- An attempt was made to access an object library  [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or function that can't be supported by Visual Basic.
    
    Contact the creator of the object library for more information on when it is appropriate to use the object library, and the tools with which it should be used.
