 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A caption is descriptive text that appears directly on or around a control. The following controls can have captions:  **CheckBox**,  **CommandButton**,  **Frame**,  **Label**,  **OptionButton**, and  **ToggleButton**. The  **Page** and **Tab** objects that are part of the **MultiPage** and **TabStrip** also can have captions.
