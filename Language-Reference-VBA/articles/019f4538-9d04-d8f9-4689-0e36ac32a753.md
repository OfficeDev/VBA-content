# FileLen Function

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Returns a  [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the length of a file in bytes.
 **Syntax**
 **FileLen(**_pathname_**)**
The required  _pathname_ [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is a [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that specifies a file. The _pathname_ may include the directory or folder, and the drive.
 **Remarks**
If the specified file is open when the  **FileLen** function is called, the value returned represents the size of the file immediately before it was opened.

 **Note**  To obtain the length of an open file, use the  **LOF** function.


## Example

This example uses the  **FileLen** function to return the length of a file in bytes. For purposes of this example, assume that `TESTFILE` is a file containing some data.


```
Dim MySize
MySize = FileLen("TESTFILE")    ' Returns file length (bytes).


```
