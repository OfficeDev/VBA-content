# Invalid use of Me keyword

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **Me** [keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can appear in [class modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:




- The  **Me** keyword appeared in a [standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    The  **Me** keyword can't appear in a standard module because a standard module doesn't represent an object. If you copied the code in question from a class module, you have to replace the **Me** keyword with the specific object or form name to preserve the original reference.
    
- The  **Me** keyword appeared on the left side of a **Set** assignment, for example:
    
  ```
  Set Me = MyObject    ' Causes "Invalid use of Me keyword" message. 

  ```


    Remove the  **Set** assignment.
    
     **Note**   The **Me** keyword can appear on the left side of a **Let** assignment, in which case the default [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the object represented by **Me** is set. For example:




```
Let Me = MyObject    ' Valid assignment with explicit Let. 
Me = MyObject    ' Valid assignment with implicit Let. 

```
