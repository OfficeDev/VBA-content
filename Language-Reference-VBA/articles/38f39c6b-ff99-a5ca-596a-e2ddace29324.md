# Cut, Paste Methods, TextBox Control Example

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The following example uses the  **Cut** and **Paste** methods to cut text from one **TextBox** and paste it into another **TextBox**.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains:



- Two  **TextBox** controls named TextBox1 and TextBox2.
    
- A  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1.
    




```
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 TextBox1.Text = "From TextBox1!" 
 TextBox2.Text = "Hello " 
 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "Cut and Paste" 
 CommandButton1.AutoSize = True 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 TextBox2.SelStart = 0 
 TextBox2.SelLength = TextBox2.TextLength 
 TextBox2.Cut 
 
 TextBox1.SetFocus 
 TextBox1.SelStart = 0 
 
 TextBox1.Paste 
 TextBox2.SelStart = 0 
End Sub
```
