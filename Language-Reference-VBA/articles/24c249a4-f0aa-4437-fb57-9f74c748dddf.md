# Optional argument must be Variant

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Optional  [arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can have any intrinsic [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but it must be a type with a single default value. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You tried to specify  **Optional** with a [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that has no default value, for example, an [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Make sure any argument specified as  **Optional** has a default value.
