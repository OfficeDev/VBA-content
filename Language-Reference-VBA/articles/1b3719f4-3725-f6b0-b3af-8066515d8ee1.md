# Turn Syntax Checking On or Off

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Visual Basic includes a syntax-checking feature that:




- Checks each statement as you enter it for  [syntax errors](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), such as a misspelled  [keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or missing separator, and alerts you if there are errors.
    
- Translates the code to an internal form if the syntax is correct, which speeds the transition to run time.
    

This feature is turned on when you first start, but you can turn it off if you prefer to write code without being alerted to errors as they occur.
