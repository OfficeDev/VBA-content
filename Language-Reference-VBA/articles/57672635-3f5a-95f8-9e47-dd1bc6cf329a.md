# Not enough memory to completely save project

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

When a  [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is saved, extra information is usually saved to make it possible to load the project in a later version or on a different platform. This error has the following cause and solution:




- Memory available is insufficient to save information that will be necessary if you attempt to load the project in a later version of Visual Basic or on a different platform. If you plan to open the project in a later version of Visual Basic or on another platform, close some applications and try to save again.
