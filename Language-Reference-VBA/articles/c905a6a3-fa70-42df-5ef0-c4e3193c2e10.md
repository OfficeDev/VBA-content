# While...Wend Statement

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Executes a series of  [statements](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as long as a given condition is **True**.

 **Syntax**

 **While**_condition_
[ _statements_]
 **Wend**
The  **While...Wend** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _condition_|Required.  [Numeric expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or [string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to **True** or **False**. If  _condition_ is [Null](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  _condition_ is treated as **False**.|
| _statements_|Optional. One or more statements executed while condition is  **True**.|
 **Remarks**
If  _condition_ is **True**, all  _statements_ are executed until the **Wend** statement is encountered. Control then returns to the **While** statement and _condition_ is again checked. If _condition_ is still **True**, the process is repeated. If it is not  **True**, execution resumes with the statement following the  **Wend** statement.
 **While...Wend** loops can be nested to any level. Each **Wend** matches the most recent **While**.

 **Tip**  The  **Do...Loop** statement provides a more structured and flexible way to perform looping.


## Example

This example uses the  **While...Wend** statement to increment a counter variable. The statements in the loop are executed as long as the condition evaluates to **True**.


```
Dim Counter 
Counter = 0 ' Initialize variable. 
While Counter < 20 ' Test value of Counter. 
 Counter = Counter + 1 ' Increment Counter. 
Wend ' End While loop when Counter > 19. 
Debug.Print Counter ' Prints 20 in the Immediate window. 

```
