# Option Private Module not permitted in object module

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **Option Private Module** makes the contents of a [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) unavailable to other [projects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), while preserving their availability to your project. This error has the following cause and solution:




- The statement  **Option Private Module** appears in an [object module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Remove the  **Option Private Module** statement from the module. Object modules have the characteristic of **Option Private Module** by default. Changing the default can't be done from code. See your [host application's](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) documentation for information on giving object module members wider visibility.
