The  [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can't be read. This error has the following cause and solution.




- A property can't be read; for example,  `ctl.property = 3` might be legal, but " `Printctl.property`" would generate this error. Change your code and remove the reference to the property.
