# Clear Method (Microsoft Forms)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Removes all objects from an object or  [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Clear**
The  **Clear** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
For a  **MultiPage** or **TabStrip**, the  **Clear** method deletes individual pages or tabs.
For a  **ListBox** or **ComboBox**,  **Clear** removes all entries in the list.
For a  **Controls** collection, **Clear** deletes controls that were created at [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) with the **Add** method. Using **Clear** on controls created at [design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) causes an error.
If the control is bound to data, the  **Clear** method fails.
