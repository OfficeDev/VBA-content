# Insufficient Immediate window memory to create variable

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Memory in the  **Immediate** window is limited. This error has the following cause and solution:




- You specified a  [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the **Immediate** window that must be instantiated, since it wasn't created in the program's code context.
    
    Delete the reference to the variable in the  **Immediate** window, or declare the variable in the program's code context so that it doesn't have to be created in the **Immediate** window.
