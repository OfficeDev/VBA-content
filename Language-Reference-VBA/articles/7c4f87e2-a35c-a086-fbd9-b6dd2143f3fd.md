Not all objects support the same set of  [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:




- This object doesn't support the specified property. Check the spelling of the property name. Also, you may be trying to access something like a "text" property when the object actually supports a "caption" or some similarly named property. Check the object's documentation.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
