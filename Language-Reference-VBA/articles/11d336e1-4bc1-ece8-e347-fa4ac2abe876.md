This error has the following causes and solutions:




- This error occurs at  [run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) when the new file name, for example, one specified in a **Name** statement, is identical to a file name that already exists.
    
    Specify a new file name in the  **Name** statement or delete the old file before specifying it in a **Name** statement.
    
- You used the  **Save As** command to save a currently loaded [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but the project name already exists.
    
    Use a different project name if you don't want to replace the other project.
