# Points Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [Point](48ed9aec-2d29-ec4d-8e55-fca13982c358.md)** objects in the specified series in a chart.

## Remarks

Use  ** [Points](9b6f08a1-3fbe-e9bc-a509-345a3d2d78b3.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the point index number, to return a single **Point** object. Points are numbered from left to right on the series. `Points(1)` is the leftmost point, and `Points(Points.Count)` is the rightmost point.


## Example

Use the  **Points** method to return the ** [Points](918dc385-ed61-262e-033f-ba829f5ee8b2.md)** collection. The following example adds a data label to the last point on series one in embedded chart one on worksheet one.


```
Dim pts As Points 
Set pts = Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Chart. _ 
 SeriesCollection(1).Points 
pts(pts.Count).ApplyDataLabels type:=xlShowValue
```

 The following example sets the marker style for the third point in series one in embedded chart one on worksheet one. The specified series must be a 2-D line, scatter, or radar series.




```
Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Chart. _ 
 SeriesCollection(1).Points(3).MarkerStyle = xlDiamond
```
