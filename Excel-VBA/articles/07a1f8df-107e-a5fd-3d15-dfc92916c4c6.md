# CalculatedMember Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the calculated fields, calculated items, and named sets for PivotTables with Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data sources.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [Add](8c6591bb-3906-6682-4dc7-89ffc2ae74f3.md)** method or the [Item](82ba55c7-0c16-df11-ac32-40868f57d2e1.md) property of the ** [CalculatedMembers](3c664ac6-e2f8-f631-006d-6a16c380641e.md)** collection to return a **CalculatedMember** object.

With a  **CalculatedMember** object you can check the validity of a calculated field or item in a PivotTable using the ** [IsValid](9b0f78c6-3435-6539-aff0-165810668dde.md)** property.




 **Note**   The **IsValid** property will return **True** if the PivotTable is not currently connected to the data source. Use the ** [MakeConnection](d0b29374-4d5a-7d9e-630a-500b505da1bd.md)** method before testing the **IsValid** property.


## Example

The following example notifies the user if the calculated member is valid or not. This example assumes a PivotTable exists on the active worksheet that contains either a valid or invalid calculated member.


```
Sub CheckValidity() 
 
 Dim pvtTable As PivotTable 
 Dim pvtCache As PivotCache 
 
 Set pvtTable = ActiveSheet.PivotTables(1) 
 Set pvtCache = Application.ActiveWorkbook.PivotCaches.Item(1) 
 
 ' Handle run-time error if external source is not an OLEDB data source. 
 On Error GoTo Not_OLEDB 
 
 ' Check connection setting and make connection if necessary. 
 If pvtCache.IsConnected = False Then 
 pvtCache.MakeConnection 
 End If 
 
 ' Check if calculated member is valid. 
 If pvtTable.CalculatedMembers.Item(1).IsValid = True Then 
 MsgBox "The calculated member is valid." 
 Else 
 MsgBox "The calculated member is not valid." 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
