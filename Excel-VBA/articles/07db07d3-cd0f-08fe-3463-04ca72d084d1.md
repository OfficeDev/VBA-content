## Syntax

 _expression_. **ImportXml**( **_XmlData_**,  **_Overwrite_**)

### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|XmlData|Required| **String**|The string that contains the XML data to import.|
|Overwrite|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies whether to overwrite the contents of cells that are currently mapped to the specified XML map. Set to  **True** to overwrite the cells; set to **False** to append the data to the existing range. If this parameter is not specified, the current value of the ** [AppendOnImport](b00eeaeb-1750-e5a9-85b5-7323ea766ead.md)** property of the XML map determines whether the contents of cells are overwritten or not.|

### Return Value

 [XlXmlImportResult](9a43512f-c2f3-f92b-f486-14e5c8bd114a.md)


## Remarks



| **XlXmlImportResult** can be one of the following **XlXmlImportResult** constants.|
| **xlXmlImportElementsTruncated**. The contents of the specified XML data file have been truncated because the XML data file is too large for the worksheet.|
| **xlXmlImportSuccess**. The XML data file was successfully imported.|
| **xlXmlImportValidationFailed**. The data being imported failed schema validation, but was imported anyway.|
To import the contents of an XML data file into cells mapped to a specific schema map, use the  ** [Import](60265bbd-4994-8fba-7072-ec5dada885d3.md)** method of the **XmlMap** object.

If either of the following conditions is true, a runtime error will occur. If more than one condition is true, Excel returns a runtime error for the most severe (they are listed below with the most severe listed first):


- If the XML data contains syntactical errors.
    
- If import is cancelled because not all of the data could fit in the worksheet.
