| _Procedure_|Required| **String**|The name of the procedure that will be run when you choose the  **Repeat** command.|

## Remarks

If a procedure doesn?t use the  **OnRepeat** method, the **Repeat** command repeats procedure that was run most recently.

## Example

This example sets the repeat and undo procedures.
