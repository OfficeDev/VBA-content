# SeriesLines Object

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents series lines in the specified chart group. Series lines connect the data values in each series. Only 2-D stacked-bar or column chart groups can have series lines. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single series line; either you have series lines turned on for all points in a chart group or you have them turned off.

## Using the SeriesLines Object

Use the  **SeriesLines** property to return the **SeriesLines** object. The following example adds series lines to chart group one in the chart. The chart must be a 2-D stacked-bar or column chart.


```
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasSeriesLines = True 
 .SeriesLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
End With
```


## Remarks

If the  ** [HasSeriesLines](fd101b78-4499-31bd-1243-47738c1eb00f.md)**property is  **False**, most properties of the  **SeriesLines** object are disabled.
