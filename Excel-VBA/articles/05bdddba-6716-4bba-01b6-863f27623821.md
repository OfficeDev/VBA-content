# Workbook.RowsetComplete Event (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The event is raised when the user either drills through the recordset or invokes the rowset action on an OLAP PivotTable.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **RowsetComplete**( **_Description_**,  **_Sheet_**,  **_Success_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Workbook** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Description|Required| **String**|A brief description of the event.|
|Sheet|Required| **String**|Worksheet on which the recordset is created.|
|Success|Required| **Boolean**|Contains a Boolean value to indicate success or failure.|

## Remarks

Because the recordset is created asynchronously, the event allows automation to determine when the action has been completed. Additionally, because the recordset is created on a separate sheet, the event needs to be on the workbook level.
