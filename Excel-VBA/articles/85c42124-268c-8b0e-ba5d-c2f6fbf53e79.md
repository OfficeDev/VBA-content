# PlotArea Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the plot area of a chart.

## Remarks

 This is the area where your chart data is plotted. The plot area on a 2-D chart contains the data markers, gridlines, data labels, trendlines, and optional chart items placed in the chart area. The plot area on a 3-D chart contains all the above items plus the walls, floor, axes, axis titles, and tick-mark labels in the chart.

The plot area is surrounded by the chart area. The chart area on a 2-D chart contains the axes, the chart title, the axis titles, and the legend. The chart area on a 3-D chart contains the chart title and the legend. For information about formatting the chart area, see the  ** [ChartArea](883423b5-7689-b164-c0a3-8dab049b5d9e.md)** object.


## Example

Use the  **PlotArea** property to return a **PlotArea** object. The following example activates the chart sheet named "Chart1," places a dashed border around the chart area of the active chart, and places a dotted border around the plot area.


```
Charts("Chart1").Activate 
With ActiveChart 
 .ChartArea.Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
 .PlotArea.Border.LineStyle = xlDot 
End With
```
