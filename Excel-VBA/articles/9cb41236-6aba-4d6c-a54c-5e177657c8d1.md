# ThreeDFormat Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a shape's three-dimensional formatting.

## Remarks

You cannot apply three-dimensional formatting to some kinds of shapes, such as beveled shapes or multiple-disjoint paths. Most of the properties and methods of the  **ThreeDFormat** object for such a shape will fail.


## Example

Use the  ** [ThreeD](4513383f-6edc-8810-4155-4188221253b6.md)** property to return a **ThreeDFormat** object. The following example adds an oval to _myDocument_ and then specifies that the oval be extruded to a depth of 50 points and that the extrusion be purple.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
Set myShape = myDocument.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeOval, _ 
 90, 90, 90, 40) 
With myShape.ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .Depth = 50 
 .ExtrusionColor.RGB = RGB(255, 100, 255) 
 ' RGB value for purple 
End With
```
