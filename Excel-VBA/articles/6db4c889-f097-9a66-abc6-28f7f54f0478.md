# CalculatedFields Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  ** [PivotField](52784960-e2da-b43a-1e37-2d4dae61c6d8.md)** objects that represents all the calculated fields in the specified PivotTable report.

## Remarks

A report that contains Revenue and Expense fields could have a calculated field named "Profit" defined as the amount in the Revenue field minus the amount in the Expense field.

For OLAP data sources, you cannot set this collection, and it always returns  **Nothing**.

Use the  ** [CalculatedFields](8f09c79d-48e7-0c75-8db2-2201fcdcc974.md)** method to return the **CalculatedFields** collection .

Use  **CalculatedFields**( _index_), where  _index_ is specified field's name or index number, to return a single **PivotField** object from the **CalculatedFields** collection.


## Example

The following example deletes the calculated fields from the PivotTable report named "Pivot1"


```
For Each fld in _ 
 Worksheets(1).PivotTables("Pivot1").CalculatedFields 
 fld.Delete 
Next
```
