# Make a Cell Blink

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

This example shows how to make cell B2 on sheet 1 blink by changing the color and the text back and forth from red to white in the  **StartBlinking** procedure. The **StopBlinking** procedure shows how to stop the blinking by clearing the value of the cell and setting the ** [ColorIndex](6d1a5bc9-7157-61e0-1e1d-b44974002c78.md)** property to white.

```
Option Explicit

Public NextBlink As Double
'The cell that you want to blink
Public Const BlinkCell As String = "Sheet1!B2"

'Start blinking
Private Sub StartBlinking()
    Application.Goto Range("A1"), 1
    'If the color is red, change the color and text to white
    If Range(BlinkCell).Interior.ColorIndex = 3 Then
        Range(BlinkCell).Interior.ColorIndex = 0
        Range(BlinkCell).Value = "White"
    'If the color is white, change the color and text to red
    Else
        Range(BlinkCell).Interior.ColorIndex = 3
        Range(BlinkCell).Value = "Red"
    End If
    'Wait one second before changing the color again
    NextBlink = Now + TimeSerial(0, 0, 1)
    Application.OnTime NextBlink, "StartBlinking", , True
End Sub

'Stop blkinking
Private Sub StopBlinking()
    'Set color to white
    Range(BlinkCell).Interior.ColorIndex = 0
    'Clear the value in the cell
    Range(BlinkCell).ClearContents
    On Error Resume Next
    Application.OnTime NextBlink, "StartBlinking", , False
    Err.Clear
End Sub
