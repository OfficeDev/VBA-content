 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  ** [DropLines](52fa64aa-0b0b-bbe1-1ec2-d866e2e35674.md)**object that represents the drop lines for a series on a line chart or area chart. Applies only to line charts or area charts. Read-only.

## Example

```
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasDropLines = True 
 With .DropLines.Border 
 .LineStyle = xlThin 
 .Weight = xlMedium 
 .ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
End With
```
