## Syntax

 _expression_. **Ispmt**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**,  **_Arg3_**,  **_Arg4_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WorksheetFunction** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Double**|Rate - the interest rate for the investment.|
|Arg2|Required| **Double**|Per - the period for which you want to find the interest, and must be between 1 and nper.|
|Arg3|Required| **Double**|Nper - the total number of payment periods for the investment.|
|Arg4|Required| **Double**|Pv - the present value of the investment. For a loan, pv is the loan amount.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks




- Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at an annual interest rate of 12 percent, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for nper.
    
- For all the arguments, the cash you pay out, such as deposits to savings or other withdrawals, is represented by negative numbers; the cash you receive, such as dividend checks and other deposits, is represented by positive numbers.
    
- For additional information about financial functions, see the PV function.
