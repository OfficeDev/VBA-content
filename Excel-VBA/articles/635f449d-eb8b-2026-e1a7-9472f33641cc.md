# UpBars Object

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the up bars in a chart group. Up bars connect points in series one with higher values in the last series in the chart group (the lines go up from series one). Only 2-D line groups that contain at least two series can have up bars. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single up bar; either you have up bars turned on for all points in a chart group or you have them turned off.

## Using the UpBars Object

Use the  **UpBars** property to return the **UpBars** object. The following example turns on up and down bars for chart group one in the chart. The example then sets the up-bar color to blue and sets the down-bar color to red.


```
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasUpDownBars = True 
 .UpBars.Interior.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
 .DownBars.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0) 
End With
```


## Remarks

If the  ** [HasUpDownBars](c3785986-a013-727c-95e6-56a732b8b40f.md)**property is  **False**, most properties of the  **UpBars** object are disabled.
