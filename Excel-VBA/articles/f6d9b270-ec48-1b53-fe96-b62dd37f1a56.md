# WorksheetFunction.RSq Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient through data points in known_y's and known_x's. For more information, see PEARSON. The r-squared value can be interpreted as the proportion of the variance in y attributable to the variance in x.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **RSq**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WorksheetFunction** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Variant**|Known_y's - an array or range of data points.|
|Arg2|Required| **Variant**|Known_x's - an array or range of data points.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks




-  Arguments can either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
    
- Logical values and text representations of numbers that you type directly into the list of arguments are counted.
    
- If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with the value zero are included.
    
- Arguments that are error values or text that cannot be translated into numbers cause errors.
    
- If known_y's and known_x's are empty or have a different number of data points, RSQ returns the #N/A error value.
    
- If known_y's and known_x's contain only 1 data point, RSQ returns the #DIV/0! error value.
    
- The equation for the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, r, is:
