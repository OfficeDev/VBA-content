 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Discards all changes in the edited cells of a PivotTable report based on an OLAP data source.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **DiscardChanges**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [PivotTable](a9c1d4a0-78a9-f9a6-6daf-91cb63e45842.md)** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

For a PivotTable report based on an OLAP data source, the method removes all values and formulas entered in value cells, and then runs a PivotTable update operation to retrieve the latest values from the data source. It sets the data source value to  **NULL** for all value cells that are edited, and also executes a **ROLLBACK TRANSACTION** statement against the OLAP server.

If you try to execute this method for a PivotTable report based on a non-OLAP data source, this method generates a run-time error.
