# Item Property (Graph)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a Range object that represents a range that's offset from the specified range. Read/write Variant.

 _expression_. **Item**( **_RowIndex_**,  **_ColumnIndex_**)

 _expression_ Required. An expression that returns one of the objects in the Applies To list.
 **RowIndex** Optional **Variant**. The row number of the cell you want to work with (the first row in the range is 1).
 **ColumnIndex** Optional **Variant**. A number or string that indicates the column number of the cell you want to work with (the first column in the range is either 1 or A).

## Remarks

Syntax 1 uses a row number and either a column number or a letter as index arguments. For more information about this syntax, see the  ** [Range](8bc4841b-72f7-34b5-a299-3357bf8f457b.md)**object. The  **_RowIndex_** and **_ColumnIndex_** arguments are relative offsets. In other words, specifying 1 for **_RowIndex_** returns cells in the first row in the range, not the first row on the datasheet.


## Example

This example clears cell B2 on the datasheet.


```
myChart.Application.DataSheet.Range("A1").Item(2, 2).Clear
```
