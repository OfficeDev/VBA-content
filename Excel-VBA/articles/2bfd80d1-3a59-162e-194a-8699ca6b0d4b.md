# AllowEditRange Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the cells that can be edited on a protected worksheet.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [Add](f88d900d-4974-4d8d-6279-0be6376fc232.md)** method or the ** [Item](c6ac67af-258d-c2bf-3169-f42a5b037f2e.md)** property of the ** [AllowEditRanges](c08bf170-f982-ecca-c026-df4b907e1dde.md)** collection to return an **AllowEditRange** object.

Once an  **AllowEditRange** object has been returned, you can use the ** [ChangePassword](1cc52121-f626-eaaa-9ea0-879634e34af7.md)** method to change the password to access a range that can be edited on a protected worksheet.


## Example

In this example, Microsoft Excel allows edits to range "A1:A4" on the active worksheet, notifies the user, then changes the password for this specified range and notifies the user of this change.


```
Sub UseChangePassword() 
 
 Dim wksOne As Worksheet 
 Dim wksPassword As String 
 
 Set wksOne = Application.ActiveSheet 
 
 wksPassword = InputBox ("Enter password for the worksheet") 
 
 ' Establish a range that can allow edits 
 ' on the protected worksheet. 
 wksOne.Protection.AllowEditRanges.Add _ 
 Title:="Classified", _ 
 Range:=Range("A1:A4"), _ 
 Password:=wksPassword 
 
 MsgBox "Cells A1 to A4 can be edited on the protected worksheet." 
 
 ' Change the password. 
 
 wksPassword = InputBox ("Enter the new password for the worksheet") 
 
 wksOne.Protection.AllowEditRanges(1).ChangePassword _ 
 Password:=wksPassword 
 
 MsgBox "The password for these cells has been changed." 
 
End Sub
```
