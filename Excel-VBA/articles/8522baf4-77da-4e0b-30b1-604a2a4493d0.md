## Syntax

 _expression_. **DownloadComponents**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DefaultWebOptions** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can set the  ** [LocationOfComponents](a3f1571d-9301-4e3f-7467-f7716f26e45f.md)**property to a central URL (on the intranet or Web) or path (local or network) to a location from which authorized users can download components when viewing your saved document. The path must be valid and must point to a location that contains the necessary components, and the user must have a valid Microsoft Office license.

Office Web components add interactivity to documents that you save as Web pages. If you view a Web page in a browser on a computer that does not have the components installed, the interactive portions of the page will be static.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example allows the Office Web components to be downloaded with the specified Web page, if they are not already installed.


```
Application.DefaultWebOptions.DownloadComponents = True 
Application.DefaultWebOptions.LocationOfComponents = _ 
 Application.Path &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; "foo"
```
