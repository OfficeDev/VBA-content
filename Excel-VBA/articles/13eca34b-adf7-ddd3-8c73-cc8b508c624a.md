# LineFormat Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents line and arrowhead formatting.

## Remarks

 For a line, the **LineFormat** object contains formatting information for the line itself; for a shape with a border, this object contains formatting information for the shape's border.


## Example

Use the  ** [Line](0db51c52-c77c-9c0d-9945-e467dbcce3a9.md)** property to return a **LineFormat** object. The following example adds a blue, dashed line to _myDocument_. There's a short, narrow oval at the line's starting point and a long, wide triangle at its end point.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes.AddLine(100, 100, 200, 300).Line 
 .DashStyle = msoLineDashDotDot 
 .ForeColor.RGB = RGB(50, 0, 128) 
 .BeginArrowheadLength = msoArrowheadShort 
 .BeginArrowheadStyle = msoArrowheadOval 
 .BeginArrowheadWidth = msoArrowheadNarrow 
 .EndArrowheadLength = msoArrowheadLong 
 .EndArrowheadStyle = msoArrowheadTriangle 
 .EndArrowheadWidth = msoArrowheadWide 
End With
```
