# PivotField.DrillTo Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **DrillTo** method supports drilling to a specified PivotField from another PivotField.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **DrillTo**( **_PivotFieldName_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotField** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PivotFieldName|Required| **String**|The name of the  **PivotField** to drill to.|

## Remarks

This operation can only be performed on fields that are actually on the PivotTable. So either a hierarchy containing the requested PivotField has to be in rows or columns of the PivotTable, or the attribute/relational field has to be in rows or columns of the PivotTable placed next to at least one other attribute/relational field. Also, the field being drilled to has to be in the same hierarchy or attribute chain. If these conditions are not met, a run-time error occurs.
