# Name.RefersToRange Property (Excel)

Returns the  **[Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object referred to by a **Name** object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **RefersToRange**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Name** object.


## Remarks

If the  **Name** object doesn't refer to a range (for example, if it refers to a constant or a formula), this property fails.

To change the range that a name refers to, use the  **[RefersTo](8093e14c-0461-5e49-ef71-16c683044a63.md)** property.


## Example

This example displays the number of rows and columns in the print area on the active worksheet.


 **Note**  Ensure that you establish a print area on the active sheet of the current workbook.


```
p = Sheets(ActiveSheet.Name).Names("Print_Area").RefersToRange.Value 
MsgBox "Print_Area: " &; UBound(p, 1) &; " rows, " &; _ 
 UBound(p, 2) &; " columns"
```
