# OLEDBError Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an OLE DB error returned by the most recent OLE DB query.

## Remarks

 The **OLEDBError** object is a member of the ** [OLEDBErrors](0e48697d-4f65-b544-4487-24a9fd2b81b6.md)** collection. If the specified OLE DB query runs without error, the **OLEDBErrors** collection is empty. The errors in the collection are indexed in the order in which they're generated by the OLE DB provider.


## Example

Use  ** [OLEDBErrors](47caef7a-fd3c-f67f-09c1-5ac21d65b67f.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the index number of the OLE DB error, to return a single **OLEDBError** object. The following example displays the error description and the ** [SqlState](cd05c61a-da9f-5022-c359-b90351e6489d.md)** property's value for the first error returned by the most recent OLE DB query.


```
Set objEr = Application.OLEDBErrors(1) 
MsgBox "The following error occurred:" &amp; _ 
 objEr.ErrorString &amp; " : " &amp; objEr.SqlState
```
