# WorksheetFunction.StEyx Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the standard error of the predicted y-value for each x in the regression. The standard error is a measure of the amount of error in the prediction of y for an individual x.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **StEyx**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WorksheetFunction** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Variant**|Known_y's - an array or range of dependent data points.|
|Arg2|Required| **Variant**|Known_x's - an array or range of independent data points.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks




- Arguments can either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
    
- Logical values and text representations of numbers that you type directly into the list of arguments are counted.
    
- If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with the value zero are included.
    
- Arguments that are error values or text that cannot be translated into numbers cause errors.
    
- If known_y's and known_x's have a different number of data points, STEYX returns the #N/A error value.
    
- If known_y's and known_x's are empty or have less than three data points, STEYX returns the #DIV/0! error value.
    
- The equation for the standard error of the predicted y is:
