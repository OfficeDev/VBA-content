# WorksheetFunction.ChiSq_Dist_RT Method (Excel)

Returns the right-tailed probability of the chi-squared distribution.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ChiSq_Dist_RT**( **_Arg1_** , **_Arg2_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[WorksheetFunction](7b1d5639-363d-632c-2cf0-2232562646b6.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Double**|The value at which you want to evaluate the distribution.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Double**|The number of degrees of freedom.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks

The ? 2 distribution is associated with a ?2 test. Use the ?2 test to compare observed and expected values.

 For example, a genetic experiment might hypothesize that the next generation of plants will exhibit a certain set of colors. By comparing the observed results with the expected ones, you can decide whether your original hypothesis is valid:


- If either argument is nonnumeric, ChiSq_Dist_RT generates an error.
    
- If x is negative, ChiSq_Dist_RT generates an error.
    
- If degrees_freedom is not an integer, it is truncated.
    
- If degrees_freedom < 1 or degrees_freedom > 10^10, ChiSq_Dist_RT generates an error.
    
- ChiSq_Dist_RT is calculated as ChiSq_Dist_RT = P(X>x), where X is a ?2 random variable.
