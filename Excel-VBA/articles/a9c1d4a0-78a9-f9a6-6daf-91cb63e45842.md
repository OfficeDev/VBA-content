# PivotTable Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a PivotTable report on a worksheet.

## Remarks

 The **PivotTable** object is a member of the ** [PivotTables](5beb33ac-a0fb-3f78-8fdc-d05719512214.md)** collection. The **PivotTables** collection contains all the **PivotTable** objects on a single worksheet.

Because PivotTable report programming can be complex, it's generally easiest to record PivotTable report actions and then revise the recorded code.


## Example

Use  ** [PivotTables](b60944cd-827d-15dc-d49e-c739c237de15.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the PivotTable index number or name, to return a single **PivotTable** object. The following example makes the field named year a row field in the first PivotTable report on Sheet3.


```
Worksheets("Sheet3").PivotTables(1) _ 
 .PivotFields("Year").Orientation = xlRowField
```
