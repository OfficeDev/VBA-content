# CubeField.LayoutSubtotalLocation Property (Excel)

Returns or sets the position of the PivotTable field subtotals in relation to (either above or below) the specified field. Read/write  **[XlSubtototalLocationType](8b9fc551-ef4a-3e95-9eec-56aa835d24cd.md)** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **LayoutSubtotalLocation**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CubeField** object.


## Remarks

You can set this property for any PivotTable field in outline format; however, the formatting appears only if the specified field is a row field other than the innermost (lowest level) row field. For non- OLAP data sources, the value of this property doesn't change when the field is rearranged or when it is added to or from removed from the report.

The  **[LayoutForm](a9077651-214f-6926-89fc-c29a1ff35682.md)** property determines whether the report appears in table format or in outline format.


## Example

This example displays the state field in the first PivotTable report on the active worksheet in outline format, and it displays the subtotals at the top of the field.


```vb
With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1") _ 
 .PivotFields("state") 
 .LayoutForm = xlOutline 
 .LayoutSubtotalLocation = xlAtTop 
End With
```
