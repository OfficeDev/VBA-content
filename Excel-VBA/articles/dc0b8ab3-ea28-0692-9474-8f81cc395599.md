Returns  **True** if the user is allowed to make use of an AutoFilter that was created before the sheet was protected. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AllowFiltering**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Protection** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **AllowFiltering** property can be set by using the ** [Protect](ed517a80-eea9-4268-5fbc-69c659beac0e.md)**method arguments.

The  **AllowFiltering** property allows the user to change filter criteria on an existing AutoFilter. The user cannot create or remove an AutoFilter on a protected worksheet.

The cells to be filtered must be unlocked when the sheet is protected.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example allows the user to filter row 1 on the protected worksheet and notifies the user.


```
Sub ProtectionOptions() 
 
 ActiveSheet.Unprotect 
 
 ' Unlock row 1. 
 Rows("1:1").Locked = False 
 
 ' Allow row 1 to be filtered on a protected worksheet. 
 If ActiveSheet.Protection.AllowFiltering = False Then 
 ActiveSheet.Protect AllowFiltering:=True 
 End If 
 
 MsgBox "Row 1 can be filtered on this protected worksheet." 
 
End Sub
```
