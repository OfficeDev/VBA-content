# Refer to Sheets by Name

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can identify sheets by name using the  ** [Worksheets](8b7d660d-ca49-0bd0-dc57-64defa47bd5e.md)**and  ** [Charts](582d9a78-d86f-ab69-0c22-85f8a59412d9.md)**properties. The following statements activate various sheets in the active workbook.



```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
Charts("Chart1").Activate
```




```
DialogSheets("Dialog1").Activate
```

You can use the  ** [Sheets](45e4e19e-55ea-9615-231d-9435ba6d5a63.md)**property to return a worksheet, chart, module, or dialog sheet. The  **Sheets** collection contains all of these kinds of sheets. The following example activates the sheet named "Chart1" in the active workbook.



```
Sub ActivateChart() 
 Sheets("Chart1").Activate 
End Sub
```


 **Note**   Charts embedded in a worksheet are members of the ** [ChartObjects](67cf2d82-ed9b-b23d-836f-19b106bcc5ed.md)**collection, whereas charts that exist on their own sheets belong to the  ** [Charts](06d4602e-a713-7ca0-db39-2d8a29f084a0.md)**collection.
