# Worksheet.Visible Property (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets an  ** [XlSheetVisibility](615955a4-2ab9-b95f-de7c-6fb3e59d25bf.md)** value that determines whether the object is visible.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Visible**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Worksheet** object.


## Example

This example hides Sheet1.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Visible = False
```

This example makes Sheet1 visible.




```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Visible = True
```

This example makes every sheet in the active workbook visible.




```
For Each sh In Sheets 
 sh.Visible = True 
Next sh
```

This example creates a new worksheet and then sets its  **Visible** property to **xlVeryHidden**. To refer to the sheet, use its object variable,  `newSheet`, as shown in the last line of the example. To use the  `newSheet` object variable in another procedure, you must declare it as a public variable ( `Public newSheet As Object`) in the first line of the module preceding any  **Sub** or **Function** procedure.




```
Set newSheet = Worksheets.Add 
newSheet.Visible = xlVeryHidden 
newSheet.Range("A1:D4").Formula = "=RAND()"
```
