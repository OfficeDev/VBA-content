# PivotFormula Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a formula used to calculate results in a PivotTable report.

## Remarks

This object and its associated properties and methods aren't available for OLAP data sources because calculated fields and items aren't supported.


## Example

Use  ** [PivotFormulas](fceade1d-7aa1-85c1-ca74-89460ffa6dff.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the formula number or string on the left side of the formula, to return the **PivotFormula** object. The following example changes the index number for formula one in the first PivotTable report on the first worksheet so that this formula will be solved after formula two.


```
Worksheets(1).PivotTables(1).PivotFormulas(1).Index = 2
```
