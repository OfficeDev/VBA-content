# ShapeNodes Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [ShapeNode](c8b60d74-f11f-1659-30a3-6e180eb8bd58.md)** objects in the specified freeform.

## Remarks

 Each **ShapeNode** object represents either a node between segments in a freeform or a control point for a curved segment of a freeform. You can create a freeform manually or by using the ** [BuildFreeform](0eec4b87-1a40-1e60-a66a-a8bb2b2f7efa.md)**and  ** [ConvertToShape](2084277d-7e6a-5675-8e46-17522c3228eb.md)** methods.


## Example

Use the  ** [Nodes](476b7ac6-d45c-c7a5-ef93-0cbe0c19ec15.md)** property to return the ** [ShapeNodes](663721f1-8bd0-dd21-2362-fea2da3988bf.md)** collection. The following example deletes node four in shape three on _myDocument_. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform with at least four nodes.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
myDocument.Shapes(3).Nodes.Delete 4
```

Use the  ** [Insert](b4f7e695-2102-5cbd-2d6b-bc167407cc0f.md)** method to create a new node and add it to the **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example adds a smooth node with a curved segment after node four in shape three on _myDocument_. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform with at least four nodes.




```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes(3).Nodes 
 .Insert 4, msoSegmentCurve, msoEditingSmooth, 210, 100 
End With
```

Use  **Nodes**( _index_), where  _index_ is the node index number, to return a single **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on _myDocument_ is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.




```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes(3) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType 1, msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
End With
```
