 **True** if Microsoft Excel is in interactive mode; this property is usually **True**. If you set the this property to  **False**, Microsoft Excel will block all input from the keyboard and mouse (except input to dialog boxes that are displayed by your code). Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Interactive**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Blocking user input will prevent the user from interfering with the macro as it moves or activates Microsoft Excel objects.

This property is useful if you're using DDE or OLE Automation to communicate with Microsoft Excel from another application.

If you set this property to  **False**, don't forget to set it back to  **True**. Microsoft Excel won't automatically set this property back to  **True** when your macro stops running.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the  **Interactive** property to **False** while it's using DDE in Windows and then sets this property back to **True** when it's finished. This prevents the user from interfering with the macro.


```
Application.Interactive = False 
Application.DisplayAlerts = False 
channelNumber = Application.DDEInitiate( _ 
 app:="WinWord", _ 
 topic:="C:\WINWORD\FORMLETR.DOC") 
Application.DDEExecute channelNumber, "[FILEPRINT]" 
Application.DDETerminate channelNumber 
Application.DisplayAlerts = True 
Application.Interactive = True
```
