Returns or sets the specified workbook to forced calculation mode. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ForceFullCalculation**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [Workbook](8c00aa60-c974-eed3-0812-3c9625eb0d4c.md)** object.


### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the workbook is in the forced calculation mode, dependencies are ignored and all worksheets are marked to calculate fully every time a calculation is triggered. This setting remains in effect until Excel is restarted.

Setting the  **ForceFullCalculation** property to **True** will increase the calculation times for data tables in proportion to the size of the data table. Given an NxM data table, the calculation time will increase by about _base time_ x ( _N_x _M_), so that a 3x4 data table may take about 12 times as long to calculate if this property is set to  **True**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example sets the active workbook to forced calculation mode.


```
ActiveWorkbook.ForceFullCalculation = True
```
