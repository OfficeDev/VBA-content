 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis in degrees. Can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates rotation to the left; a negative value indicates rotation to the right. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RotationY**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ThreeDFormat** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis, use the  ** [RotationX](e9866449-2d84-1e47-276b-69c2feec713c.md)**property of the  **ThreeDFormat** object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the ** [Rotation](336d7d04-9c22-c632-5d85-feefff22023c.md)**property of the  ** [Shape](8f01fcd1-b7d9-5216-2de5-40fb6648a403.md)**object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the  ** [SetExtrusionDirection](363c3150-fa6d-fcb3-d61d-00a36b528387.md)**method.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to  `myDocument` and sets their rotation around the y-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 30, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 70, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 110, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 30 
 End With 
End With
```
