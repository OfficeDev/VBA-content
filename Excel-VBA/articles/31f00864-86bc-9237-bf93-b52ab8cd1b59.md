# HasDropLines Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **True** if the line chart or area chart has drop lines. Applies only to line and area charts. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Example

This example turns on drop lines for chart group one and then sets their line style, weight, and color. The example should be run on a 2-D line chart that has one series.


```
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasDropLines = True 
 With .DropLines.Border 
 .LineStyle = xlThin 
 .Weight = xlMedium 
 .ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
End With
```
