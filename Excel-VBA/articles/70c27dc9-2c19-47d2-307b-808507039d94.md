# PivotFilter Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A PivotFilter is applied to a  **PivotField** object.

## Remarks

Developers have the option of naming filters for reference since the index is not reliable. The  **DataField**property specifies the PivotField to base a value filter on.
