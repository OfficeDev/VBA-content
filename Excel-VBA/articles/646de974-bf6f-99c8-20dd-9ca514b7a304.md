# ErrorBars Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the error bars on a chart series.

## Remarks

 Error bars indicate the degree of uncertainty for chart data. Only series in area, bar, column, line, and scatter groups on a 2-D chart can have error bars. Only series in scatter groups can have x and y error bars. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single error bar; you either have x error bars or y error bars turned on for all points in a series or you have them turned off.

The  ** [ErrorBar](0f127c27-09d3-a0e0-7a1d-5e3544039658.md)** method changes the error bar format and type.


## Example

Use the  ** [ErrorBars](1a607e6f-e70a-e39c-4cc3-6060eb64e654.md)** property to return the **ErrorBars** object. The following example turns on error bars for series one in embedded chart one and then sets the end style for the error bars.


```
Worksheets("sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Activate 
ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).HasErrorBars = True 
ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).ErrorBars.EndStyle = xlNoCap
```
