# RectangularGradient Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **RectangularGradient** object transitions through a series of colors in a linear manner along a specific angle.

## Remarks


- Attempting to access a Gradient property of an  **Interior** object that does not have an existing gradient fill will result in a Run Time Error. Be aware of the `Interior.Pattern` property before accessing the Gradient property.
    
- If  [Interior.Pattern](90587a6d-273c-00df-bb12-1a4415591705.md) is changed from a gradient type to a non-gradient type, the Gradient object will populate with default values.
