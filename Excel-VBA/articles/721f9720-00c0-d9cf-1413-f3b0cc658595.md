## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AddMemberPropertyField**( **_Property_**,  **_PropertyOrder_**,  **_PropertyDisplayedIn_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CubeField** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Property|Required| **String**|The unique name of the member property. For balanced hierarchies, a unique name can be created by appending the "quoted" member property name to the unique name of the level with which the member property is associated. For unbalanced hierarchies, a unique name can be created by appending the "quoted" member property name to the unique name of the hierarchy.|
|PropertyOrder|Optional| **Variant**|Sets the  ** [PropertyOrder](b938d2bd-3e64-a861-c058-96daa81830bf.md)** property value for a **CubeField** object. The actual position in the collection will be immediately before the PivotTable field that currently has the same **PropertyOrder** value that is given in the argument. If no field has the given property order value, the range of acceptable values is 1 to the number of member properties already showing for the hierarchy plus one. This argument is one-based. If omitted, the property goes to the end of the list.|
|PropertyDisplayedIn|Optional| ** [XlPropertyDisplayedIn](5df825f7-6aa4-7652-5405-33e4a0e2a0c2.md)**|Specifies where to display the property. If this argument is omitted, the member property field will be added to the PivotTable only.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The property field specified will not be viewable if the PivotTable view has no fields.

To delete member properties, use the  **Delete** method to delete the **PivotField** object from the **PivotFields** collection.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

In this example, Microsoft Excel adds a member property field titled "Description" to the PivotTable report view. This example assumes that a PivotTable exists on the active worksheet and that "Country", "Area", and "Description" are items in the report.


```
Sub UseAddMemberPropertyField() 
 
 Dim pvtTable As PivotTable 
 
 Set pvtTable = ActiveSheet.PivotTables(1) 
 
 With pvtTable 
 .ManualUpdate = True 
 .CubeFields("[Country]").LayoutForm = xlOutline 
 .CubeFields("[Country]").AddMemberPropertyField _ 
 Property:="[Country].[Area].[Description]" 
 .ManualUpdate = False 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
