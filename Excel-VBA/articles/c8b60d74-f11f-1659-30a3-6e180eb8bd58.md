# ShapeNode Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform.

## Remarks

 Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The **ShapeNode** object is a member of the ** [ShapeNodes](663721f1-8bd0-dd21-2362-fea2da3988bf.md)** collection. The **ShapeNodes** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.


## Example

Use  ** [Nodes](476b7ac6-d45c-c7a5-ef93-0cbe0c19ec15.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the node index number, to return a single **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on _myDocument_ is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes(3) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType 1, msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
End With
```
