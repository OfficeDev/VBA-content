# Watches Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [Watch](de403bcc-b927-90f6-75d7-9c936c7f58f7.md)** objects in a specified application.

## Example

Use the  ** [Watches](487c5cad-67bf-3bc9-dbc4-6bd8a105ed5e.md)** property of the ** [Application](19b73597-5cf9-4f56-8227-b5211f657f6f.md)** object to return a **Watches** collection.



In the following example, Microsoft Excel creates a new  **Watch** object using the ** [Add](18553797-09b9-b99b-c3f3-50864ec2c55a.md)** method. This example creates a summation formula in cell A3, and then adds this cell to the watch facility.




```
Sub AddWatch() 
 
 With Application 
 .Range("A1").Formula = 1 
 .Range("A2").Formula = 2 
 .Range("A3").Formula = "=Sum(A1:A2)" 
 .Range("A3").Select 
 .Watches.Add Source:=ActiveCell 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```

You can specify to remove individual cells from the watch facility by using the  ** [Delete](a6072aa8-fa9a-759d-0ead-e5908b4ec82b.md)** method of the **Watches** collection. This example deletes cell A3 on worksheet 1 of book 1 from the Watch Window. This example assumes you have added the cell A3 on sheet 1 of book 1 (using the previous example to add a **Watch** object).




```
Sub DeleteAWatch() 
 
 Application.Watches(Workbooks("Book1").Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A3")).Delete 
 
End Sub
```

You can also specify to remove all cells from the Watch Window, by using the  **Delete** method of the **Watches** collection. This example deletes all cells from the Watch Window.




```
Sub DeleteAllWatches() 
 
 Application.Watches.Delete 
 
End Sub
```
