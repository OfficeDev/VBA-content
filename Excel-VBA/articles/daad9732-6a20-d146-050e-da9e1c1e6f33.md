# CalculatedItems Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  ** [PivotItem](5829a1d9-0924-9ce8-1120-229e4595285a.md)** objects that represent all the calculated items in the specified PivotTable report.

## Remarks

A PivotTable report that contains January, February, and March items could have a calculated item named "FirstQuarter" defined as the sum of the amounts in January, February, and March.

Use the  ** [CalculatedItems](89818448-9a1e-0dcd-5e0f-479bf051d590.md)** method to return the **CalculatedItems** collection.

Use  **CalculatedFields**( _index_), where  _index_ is the name or index number of the field, to return a single ** [PivotField](52784960-e2da-b43a-1e37-2d4dae61c6d8.md)** object from the ** [CalculatedFields](6db4c889-f097-9a66-abc6-28f7f54f0478.md)** collection.


## Example

The following example creates a list of the calculated items in the first PivotTable report on worksheet one, along with their formulas.


```
Set pt = Worksheets(1).PivotTables(1) 
For Each ci In pt.PivotFields("Sales").CalculatedItems 
 r = r + 1 
 With Worksheets(2) 
 .Cells(r, 1).Value = ci.Name 
 .Cells(r, 2).Value = ci.Formula 
 End With 
Next
```
