# GapDepth Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets the distance between the data series on a 3-D chart, as a percentage of the marker width. The value of this property must be between 0 and 500. Read/write  **Long**.

## Example

This example sets the distance between the data series to 200 percent of the marker width. The example should be run on a 3-D chart (the  **GapDepth** property fails on 2-D charts).


```
myChart.GapDepth = 200
```
