# Comment Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a cell comment.

## Remarks

 The **Comment** object is a member of the ** [Comments](f43bf021-1e46-10cf-09bf-070fc6a2c81a.md)** collection.


## Example

Use the  ** [Comment](94c07e38-f232-3fba-f08c-878d3848ac55.md)** property to return a **Comment** object. The following example changes the text in the comment in cell E5.


```
Worksheets(1).Range("E5").Comment.Text "reviewed on " &amp; Date
```

Use  **Comments**( _index_), where  _index_ is the comment number, to return a single comment from the **Comments** collection. The following example hides comment two on worksheet one.




```
Worksheets(1).Comments(2).Visible = False
```

Use the  ** [AddComment](89bbacad-4655-bcc1-8010-2ab367cc7b31.md)** method to add a comment to a range. The following example adds a comment to cell E5 on worksheet one.




```
With Worksheets(1).Range("e5").AddComment 
 .Visible = False 
 .Text "reviewed on " &amp; Date 
End With
```
