# Name a Worksheet By Using a Cell Value

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

This example shows how to name a worksheet by using the value in cell A1 on that sheet. This example verifies that the value in cell A1 is a valid worksheet name, and if it is a valid name, renames the active worksheet to equal the value of cell A1 by using the  ** [Name](3d000cdf-5e81-8701-ca7f-bdcce006363b.md)** property of the ** [Worksheet](182b705e-854a-81cc-a4b0-59b942de55ae.md)** object.
