# Application.Columns Property (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object that represents all the columns on the active worksheet. If the active document isn't a worksheet, the **Columns** property fails.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Columns**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks

Using this property without an object qualifier is equivalent to using  `ActiveSheet.Columns`.

When applied to a  **Range** object that's a multiple-area selection, this property returns columns from only the first area of the range. For example, if the **Range** object has two areas â€” A1:B2 and C3:D4 â€” `Selection.Columns.Count` returns 2, not 4. To use this property on a range that may contain a multiple-area selection, test `Areas.Count` to determine whether the range contains more than one area. If it does, loop over each area in the range.
