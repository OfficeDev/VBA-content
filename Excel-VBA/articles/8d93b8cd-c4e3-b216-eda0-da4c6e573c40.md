 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  ** [CommandBars](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0e312e21-14ee-5055-d604-b66e61c53b47%28Office.15%29.aspx)** object that represents the Microsoft Excel command bars. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CommandBars**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Workbook** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Used with the  ** [Application](19b73597-5cf9-4f56-8227-b5211f657f6f.md)** object, this property returns the set of built-in and custom command bars available to the application.

When a workbook is embedded in another application and activated by the user by double-clicking the workbook, using this property with a  ** [Workbook](8c00aa60-c974-eed3-0812-3c9625eb0d4c.md)** object returns the set of Microsoft Excel command bars available within the other application. At all other times, using this property with a **Workbook** object returns **Nothing**.

There is no programmatic way to return the set of command bars attached to a workbook.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example deletes all custom command bars that aren't visible.


```
For Each bar In Application.CommandBars 
    If Not bar.BuiltIn And Not bar.Visible Then bar.Delete 
Next
```
