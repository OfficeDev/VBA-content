 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the test for independence.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ChiSq_Test**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [WorksheetFunction](7b1d5639-363d-632c-2cf0-2232562646b6.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Variant**|The range of data that contains observations to test against expected values.|
|Arg2|Required| **Variant**|The range of data that contains the ratio of the product of row totals and column totals to the grand total.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks

ChiSq_Test returns the value from the chi-squared (Ï‡ 2 ) distribution for the statistic and the appropriate degrees of freedom. You can use Ï‡2 tests to determine whether hypothesized results are verified by an experiment:


- If actual_range and expected_range have a different number of data points, ChiSq_Test returns the #N/A error value.
    
- The Ï‡2 test first calculates a Ï‡2 statistic using the formula:
![](../images/awfchtst_ZA06051120.gif)where: A ij = actual frequency in the i-th row, j-th column Eij = expected frequency in the i-th row, j-th column r = number or rows c = number of columns
    
- A low value of Ï‡ 2 is an indicator of independence. As can be seen from the formula, Ï‡2 is always positive or 0, and is 0 only if Aij = Eij for every i,j.
    
- ChiSq_Test returns the probability that a value of the Ï‡ 2 statistic at least as high as the value calculated by the above formula could have happened by chance under the assumption of independence. In computing this probability, ChiSq_Test uses the Ï‡2 distribution with an appropriate number of degrees of freedom, df. If r > 1 and c > 1, then df = (r - 1)(c - 1). If r = 1 and c > 1, then df = c - 1 or if r > 1 and c = 1, then df = r - 1. r = c= 1 is not allowed and generates an error.
    
- Use of ChiSq_Test is most appropriate when E ij 's are not too small. Some statisticians suggest that each Eij should be greater than or equal to 5.
