 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Performs a writeback operation for all edited cells in a range based on an OLAP data source.

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object.


## Remarks

The  **AllocateChanges** method will execute an **UPDATE CUBE** statement for all changes made in the range since the last apply changes operation was committed. This method generates a run-time error if it is executed on a range based on a non-OLAP data source.
