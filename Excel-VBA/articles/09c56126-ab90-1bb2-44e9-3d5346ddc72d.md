 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the depreciation of an asset for a specified period using the fixed-declining balance method.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Db**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**,  **_Arg3_**,  **_Arg4_**,  **_Arg5_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WorksheetFunction** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Double**|Cost - the initial cost of the asset.|
|Arg2|Required| **Double**|Salvage - the value at the end of the depreciation (sometimes called the salvage value of the asset).|
|Arg3|Required| **Double**|Life - the number of periods over which the asset is being depreciated (sometimes called the useful life of the asset).|
|Arg4|Required| **Double**|Period - the period for which you want to calculate the depreciation. Period must use the same units as life.|
|Arg5|Optional| **Variant**|Month - the number of months in the first year. If month is omitted, it is assumed to be 12.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks




- The fixed-declining balance method computes depreciation at a fixed rate. DB uses the following formulas to calculate depreciation for a period: (cost - total depreciation from prior periods) * rate where: rate = 1 - ((salvage / cost) ^ (1 / life)), rounded to three decimal places 
    
- Depreciation for the first and last periods is a special case. For the first period, DB uses this formula: cost * rate * month / 12 
    
- For the last period, DB uses this formula: ((cost - total depreciation from prior periods) * rate * (12 - month)) / 12
