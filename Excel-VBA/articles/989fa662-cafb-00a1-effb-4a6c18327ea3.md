# PivotField.EnableMultiplePageItems Property (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Used for specifying whether or not check boxes are present in the filter drop-down list for fields in the page area. Read/write  **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **EnableMultiplePageItems**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotField** object.


## Remarks

The existing property value is retained for OLAP.


 **Note**  In Excel 2007 or later, if you create pre-Excel 2007 OLAP PivotTables (PivotTable.Version < 3) with the  **SubtotalHiddenPageItems** property of the **PivotTable** object and the **EnableMultiplePageItems** property of the **PivotField** object set to **True**, changing the state of the check boxes in the filter drop-down menu of the page area will have no effect. In this case, the filter will always be set to  **All**, including the unchecked (hidden) items.
