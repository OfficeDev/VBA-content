# Chart.Activate Event (Excel)

## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Activate**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Chart** object.

When you switch between two windows showing the same workbook, the WindowActivate event occurs, but the Activate event for the workbook doesn't occur.


## Example

```vb
Private Sub Worksheet_Activate() 
 Range("a1:a10").Sort Key1:=Range("a1"), Order:=xlAscending 
End Sub
```
