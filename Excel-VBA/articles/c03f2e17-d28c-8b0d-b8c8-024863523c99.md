 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Continues a search that was begun with the  ** [Find](d9585265-8164-cb4d-a9e3-262f6e06b6b8.md)**method. Finds the previous cell that matches those same conditions and returns a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object that represents that cell. Doesn't affect the selection or the active cell.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **FindPrevious**( **_After_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Range** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|After|Optional| **Variant**|The cell before which you want to search. This corresponds to the position of the active cell when a search is done from the user interface. Note that After must be a single cell in the range. Remember that the search begins before this cell; the specified cell isn't searched until the method wraps back around to this cell. If this argument isn't specified, the search starts before the upper- left cell in the range.|

### Return Value

Range


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When the search reaches the beginning of the specified search range, it wraps around to the end of the range. To stop a search when this wraparound occurs, save the address of the first found cell, and then test each successive found-cell address against this saved address.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example shows how the  **FindPrevious** method is used with the **Find** and ** [FindNext](308c6241-2398-13e6-ba68-17ec713376f6.md)** methods. Before running this example, make sure that Sheet1 contains at least two occurrences of the word "Phoenix" in column B.


```
Sub FindTest() 
 Dim fc As Range 
 Set fc = Worksheets("Sheet1").Columns("B").Find(what:="Phoenix") 
 MsgBox "The first occurrence is in cell " &amp; fc.Address 
 Set fc = Worksheets("Sheet1").Columns("B").FindNext(after:=fc) 
 MsgBox "The next occurrence is in cell " &amp; fc.Address 
 Set fc = Worksheets("Sheet1").Columns("B").FindPrevious(after:=fc) 
 MsgBox "The previous occurrence is in cell " &amp; fc.Address 
End Sub
```
