# Chart.Elevation Property (Excel)

Returns or sets the elevation of the 3-D chart view, in degrees. Read/write  **Long** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Elevation**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Chart** object.


## Remarks

The chart elevation is the height at which you view the chart, in degrees. The default is 15 for most chart types. The value of this property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44.


## Example

This example sets the chart elevation of Chart1 to 34 degrees. The example should be run on a 3-D chart (the  **Elevation** property fails on 2-D charts).


```vb
Charts("Chart1").Elevation = 34
```
