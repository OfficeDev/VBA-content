# Create a Workbook

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

To create a workbook in Visual Basic, use the  ** [Add](ea9f2a2c-3cad-0c35-37b5-82da2f24b876.md)**method. The following procedure creates a workbook. Microsoft Excel automatically names the workbook Book _N_, where  _N_ is the next available number. The new workbook becomes the active workbook.



```
Sub AddOne() 
 Workbooks.Add 
End Sub
```

A better way to create a workbook is to assign it to an object variable. In the following example, the  ** [Workbook](8c00aa60-c974-eed3-0812-3c9625eb0d4c.md)**object returned by the  **Add** method is assigned to an object variable, `newBook`. Next, several properties of  `newBook` are set. You can easily control the new workbook by using the object variable.



```
Sub AddNew() 
Set NewBook = Workbooks.Add 
 With NewBook 
 .Title = "All Sales" 
 .Subject = "Sales" 
 .SaveAs Filename:="Allsales.xls" 
 End With 
End Sub
```
