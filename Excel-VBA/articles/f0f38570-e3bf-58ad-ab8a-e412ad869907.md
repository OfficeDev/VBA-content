# CustomProperties Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  **CustomProperty** objects that represent additional information. The information can be used as metadata for XML.

## Remarks

Use  ** [CustomProperties](49862772-caff-90a1-3266-c8b158003aff.md)** property of the **Worksheet** object to return a **CustomProperties** collection.

Once a  **CustomProperties** collection is returned, you can add metadata to worksheets and additional actions depending on which you choose to work with.

To add metadata to a worksheet, use the  **CustomProperties** property with the **Add** method.


## Example

The following example demonstrates this feature. In this example, Microsoft Excel adds identifier information to the active worksheet and returns the name and value to the user.


```
Sub CheckCustomProperties() 
 
 Dim wksSheet1 As Worksheet 
 
 Set wksSheet1 = Application.ActiveSheet 
 
 ' Add metadata to worksheet. 
 wksSheet1.CustomProperties.Add _ 
 Name:="Market", Value:="Nasdaq" 
 
 ' Display metadata. 
 With wksSheet1.CustomProperties.Item(1) 
 MsgBox .Name &amp; vbTab &amp; .Value 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
