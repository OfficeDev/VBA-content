 _expression_. **BaseUnit**

## Remarks

Setting this property has no visible effect if the  **CategoryType** property for the specified axis is set to **xlCategoryScale**. The set value is retained, however, and takes effect when the  **CategoryType** property is set to **xlTimeScale**.

You cannot set this property for a value axis.


## Example

This example sets the category axis on the chart to use a time scale, with months as the base unit.


```
With myChart 
 With .Axes(xlCategory) 
 .CategoryType = xlTimeScale 
 .BaseUnit = xlMonths 
 End With 
End With
```
