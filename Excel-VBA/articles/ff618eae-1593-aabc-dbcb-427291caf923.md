# OLEDBConnection.MakeConnection Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Establishes a connection for the specified OLE DB connection.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **MakeConnection**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **OLEDBConnection** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **MakeConnection** method can be used when a connection drops and the user wants to reestablish the connection.

Various objects and methods might return a run-time error if the connection is dropped. Use of this method assures a connection before executing other objects or methods.




 **Note**  Microsoft Excel might drop a connection temporarily in the course of a session (unknown to the VBA programmer), so this method proves useful.

This method will result in a run-time error if the  ** [MaintainConnection](ce913d74-d86d-006c-4def-da04a8c630b6.md)** property of the specified OLE DB connection has been set to **False**.
