 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an item in a workbook that has been saved to a Web page and can be refreshed according to values specified by the properties and methods of the  **PublishObject** object.

## Remarks

 The **PublishObject** object is a member of the ** [PublishObjects](33ad393e-5ab6-2531-5e5b-42930fc596c0.md)** collection.


## Example

Use  ** [PublishObjects](b6418f80-5154-6e3f-7313-222e6438c0e1.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the index number of the specified item in the workbook, to return a single **PublishObject** object. The following example sets the location where the first item in workbook three is saved.


```
Workbooks(3).PublishObjects(1).FileName = _ 
 "\\myserver\public\finacct\statemnt.htm"
```
