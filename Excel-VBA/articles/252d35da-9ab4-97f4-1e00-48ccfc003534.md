# GroupShapes Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the individual shapes within a grouped shape.

## Remarks

 Each shape is represented by a ** [Shape](8f01fcd1-b7d9-5216-2de5-40fb6648a403.md)** object. Using the ** [Item](efd7e247-5976-95b1-3365-34997feb323f.md)** method with this object, you can work with single shapes within a group without having to ungroup them.


## Example

Use the  ** [GroupItems](4b065113-df60-7348-a2da-898aece10f01.md)** property to return the **GroupShapes** collection. Use ** [GroupItems](4b065113-df60-7348-a2da-898aece10f01.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the number of the individual shape within the grouped shape, to return a single shape from the **GroupShapes** collection. The following example adds three triangles to _myDocument_, groups them, sets a color for the entire group, and then changes the color for the second triangle only.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes 
 .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, _ 
 10, 10, 100, 100).Name = "shpOne" 
 .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, _ 
 150, 10, 100, 100).Name = "shpTwo" 
 .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, _ 
 300, 10, 100, 100).Name = "shpThree" 
 With .Range(Array("shpOne", "shpTwo", "shpThree")).Group 
 .Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureBlueTissuePaper 
 .GroupItems(2).Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureGreenMarble 
 End With 
End With
```
