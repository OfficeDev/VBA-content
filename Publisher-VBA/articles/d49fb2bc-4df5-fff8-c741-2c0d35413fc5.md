 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Adds a new  **Shape** object representing an open polyline or a closed polygon to the specified **Shapes** collection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AddPolyline**( **_SafeArrayOfPoints_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SafeArrayOfPoints|Required| **Variant**|An array of coordinate pairs that specifies the polyline's or polygon's vertices.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For the array elements in  **_SafeArrayOfPoints_**, numeric values are evaluated in points; strings can be in any units supported by Microsoft Publisher (for example, "2.5 in").

To form a closed polygon, assign the same coordinates to the first and last vertices in the polyline drawing.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example adds a triangle to the first page of the active publication. Because the first and last points have the same coordinates, the polygon is closed.


```
Dim shpPolyline As Shape 
Dim arrPoints(1 To 4, 1 To 2) As Single 
 
arrPoints(1, 1) = 25 
arrPoints(1, 2) = 100 
arrPoints(2, 1) = 100 
arrPoints(2, 2) = 150 
arrPoints(3, 1) = 150 
arrPoints(3, 2) = 50 
arrPoints(4, 1) = 25 
arrPoints(4, 2) = 100 
 
Set shpPolyline = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes.AddPolyline _ 
 (SafeArrayOfPoints:=arrPoints)
```
