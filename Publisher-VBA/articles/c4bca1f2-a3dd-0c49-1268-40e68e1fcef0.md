With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3) 
 
 ' Verify that the shape is an OLE object. 
 If .Type = pbEmbeddedOLEObject Or _ 
 .Type = pbLinkedOLEObject Then 
 
 ' Loop through the ObjectVerbs collection 
 ' until the "Open" verb is found. 
 For Each strVerb In .OLEFormat.ObjectVerbs 
 intVerb = intVerb + 1 
 If strVerb = "Open" Then
