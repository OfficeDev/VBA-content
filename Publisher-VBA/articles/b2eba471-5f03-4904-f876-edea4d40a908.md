This example adds a rectangle to the active publication and sets the degree of its fill gradient to match that of the shape named Rectangle 2. If Rectangle 2 doesn't have a one-color gradient fill, this example generates an error.


```
Dim sngDegree As Single 
 
With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes 
 ' Store degree of one-color gradient. 
 sngDegree = .Item("Rectangle 2").Fill.GradientDegree 
 ' Add new rectangle. 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 0, 0, 40, 80).Fill 
 ' Set color and gradient for new rectangle. 
 .ForeColor.RGB = RGB(128, 0, 0) 
 .OneColorGradient Style:=msoGradientHorizontal, _ 
 Variant:=1, Degree:=sngDegree 
 End With 
End With
