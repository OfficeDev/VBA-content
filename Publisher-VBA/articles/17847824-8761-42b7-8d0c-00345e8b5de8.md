 **Note**  The  **Ligature** property has an effect only for OpenType fonts that contain ligatures.

Ligatures are alternate appearances of sequences of characters; multiple characters are merged into one glyph. For example, when ligatures are turned on for the word  _Office_, the letters  _ffi_ are all joined together into one glyph that displays a continuous line from the first _f_ through the dot in the _i_.
