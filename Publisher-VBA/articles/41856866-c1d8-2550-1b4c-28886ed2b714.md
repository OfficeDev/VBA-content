# ScratchArea Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the area outside the boundaries of publication pages where layout elements may be stored with no effect on publication output.

## Example

Use the  ** [ScratchArea](782d9b7f-b620-60f0-c21d-04f588c37cc6.md)** property of the **Document** object to return a scratch area. Use the **Shapes** property of the **ScratchArea** object to return the collection of shapes that are currently on a scratch area.



This example assigns the first shape on the scratch area of the active document to a variable.




```
Dim saPage As ScratchArea 
Dim objFirst As Object 
 
saPage = Application.ActiveDocument.ScratchArea 
objFirst = saPage.Shapes(1)
```
