## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CustomLength**( **_Length_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CalloutFormat** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Length|Required| **Variant**|The length of the first segment of the callout. Numeric values are evaluated in points; strings can be in any unit supported by Microsoft Publisher (for example, "2.5 in").|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Applying this method sets the  ** [AutoLength](ed874ec4-d4ce-5e3f-771a-8b3158f40707.md)**property to  **False** and sets the ** [Length](878fdb7b-fca6-49b6-1ec0-143243ce014c.md)**property to the value specified for the  **_Length_** argument.

Use the  ** [AutomaticLength](3772ad87-9808-5f25-0b9c-cdd7b1392ca1.md)**method to specify that the first segment of the callout line be scaled automatically whenever the callout is moved. Applies only to callouts whose lines consist of more than one segment (types  **msoCalloutThree** and **msoCalloutFour**).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example switches between an automatically-scaling first segment and one with a fixed length for the callout line for the first shape in the active publication. For the example to work, this shape must be a callout.


```
With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).Callout 
 If .AutoLength Then 
 .CustomLength Length:=50 
 Else 
 .AutomaticLength 
 End If 
End With
```
