The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Recolor** method to change the color of a picture. It recolors the first shape in the **Shapes** collection on the first page of the publication. After running the code, you can restore the original colors by using the ** [RestoreOriginalColors](13a0d09f-f809-a1ca-73d9-313ea293d56a.md)** method.

For this example to work, the shape to be recolored must be either a picture or an OLE object that represents a picture.




```

 Dim pubPictureFormat As Publisher.PictureFormat 
 Dim pubShape As Publisher.Shape 
 Dim pubColorFormat As Publisher.ColorFormat

 Set pubPictureFormat = pubShape.PictureFormat 
 Set pubColorFormat = pubShape.Fill.BackColor 
 
 pubPictureFormat.Recolor pubColorFormat, msoTrue 
 
End Sub
```
