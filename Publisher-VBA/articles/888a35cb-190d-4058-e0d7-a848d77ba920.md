 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Adds a new  ** [Shape](666cb7f0-62a8-f419-9838-007ef29506ee.md)** object representing a BÃ©zier curve to the specified ** [Shapes](52e069a6-d54b-a11a-1cba-96174329cb02.md)** collection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AddCurve**( **_SafeArrayOfPoints_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SafeArrayOfPoints|Required| **Variant**|An array of coordinate pairs that specifies the vertices and control points of the curve. The first point you specify is the starting vertex, and the next two points are control points for the first BÃ©zier segment. Then, for each additional segment of the curve, you specify a vertex and two control points. The last point you specify is the ending vertex for the curve. Note that you must always specify 3n + 1 points, where n is the number of segments in the curve.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For the array elements in  **_SafeArrayOfPoints_**, numeric values are evaluated in points; strings can be in any units supported by Microsoft Publisher (for example, "2.5 in").


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example adds a two-segment BÃ©zier curve to the first page of the active publication.


```
Dim shpCurve As Shape 
Dim arrPoints(1 To 4, 1 To 2) As Single 
 
arrPoints(1, 1) = 0 
arrPoints(1, 2) = 0 
arrPoints(2, 1) = 72 
arrPoints(2, 2) = 72 
arrPoints(3, 1) = 144 
arrPoints(3, 2) = 36 
arrPoints(4, 1) = 216 
arrPoints(4, 2) = 108 
 
Set shpCurve = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes.AddCurve _ 
 (SafeArrayOfPoints:=arrPoints)
```
