# Font Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains font attributes (font name, font size, color, and so on) for an object.

## Example

Use the  ** [Font](80d7177a-fef9-c3fd-f559-94644a2ba0f7.md)** property to return the **Font** object. The following instruction applies bold formatting to the selection.


```
Sub BoldText() 
 Selection.TextRange.Font.Bold = True 
End Sub
```

The following example formats the first paragraph in the active publication as 24-point Arial and italic.




```
Sub FormatText() 
 Dim txtRange As TextRange 
 Set txtRange = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange 
 With txtRange.Font 
 .Bold = True 
 .Name = "Arial" 
 .Size = 24 
 End With 
End Sub
```

The following example changes the formatting of the Heading 2 style in the active publication to Arial and bold.




```
Sub FormatStyle() 
 With ActiveDocument.TextStyles("Normal").Font 
 .Name = "Tahoma" 
 .Italic = True 
 .Size = 15 
 End With 
End Sub
```

You can also duplicate a  **Font** object by using the ** [Duplicate](545dbfdb-4cd5-99b1-1ba3-b723e8d7b827.md)**property. The following example creates a new character style with the character formatting from the selection in addition to italic formatting. The formatting of the selection is not changed.




```
Sub DuplicateFont() 
 Dim fntNew As Font 
 Set fntNew = Selection.TextRange.Font.Duplicate 
 fntNew.Italic = True 
 ActiveDocument.TextStyles.Add(StyleName:="Italics").Font = fntNew 
End Sub
```
