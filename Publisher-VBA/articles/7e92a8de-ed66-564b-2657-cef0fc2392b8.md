# Section Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a Section of a publication or document.

## Example

Use  **Sections**.Item(index) where index is the index number, to return a single  **Section** object. The following example sets a **Section** object to the first section in the **Sections** collection of the active document.


```
Dim objSection As Section 
Set objSection = ActiveDocument.Sections.Item(1)
```

Use  **Sections**.Add(StartPageIndex) where StartPageIndex is the index number of the page, to return a new section added to a document. A "Permission denied." error will be returned if the page already contains a section head. The following example adds a Section object to the second page of the active document.




```
Dim objSection As Section 
Set objSection = ActiveDocument.Sections.Add(StartPageIndex:=2)
```
