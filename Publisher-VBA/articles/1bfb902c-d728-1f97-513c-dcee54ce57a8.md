# ParagraphFormat.AttachedToText Property (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **True** if the **Font** or **ParagraphFormat** object is attached to a **TextRange** object. If the object is attached to a **TextRange** object, the document will be updated when properties of the object are changed. If the object is not attached, nothing in the document will be changed until the object is applied to a **TextRange** or **Style** object. Read-only **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **AttachedToText**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ParagraphFormat** object.


## Example

This example duplicates the font formatting; then it checks to see if the duplicated formatting is attached to a text range and if it is not, it attaches the formatting to the second shape.


```
Sub DuplicateText() 
 Dim fntTemp As Font 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1) 
 Set fntTemp = .Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange.Font.Duplicate 
 If fntTemp.AttachedToText <> True Then _ 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(2) _ 
 .TextFrame.TextRange.Font = fntTemp 
 End With 
End Sub
```
