# MailMergeDataSource Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the data source in a mail merge or catalog merge operation.

## Example

Use the  ** [DataSource](19b32513-fd57-617a-38e2-6230e3e036b9.md)** property to return the **MailMergeDataSource** object. The following example displays the name of the data source associated with the active publication.


```
Sub ShowDataSourceName() 
 If ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Name <> "" Then _ 
 MsgBox ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Name 
End Sub
```

The following example tests the open data source associated with the active publication to determine whether the LastName field includes the name Fuller.




```
Sub FindSelectedRecord() 
 With ActiveDocument.MailMerge 
 If .DataSource.FindRecord(FindText:="Fuller", _ 
 Field:="LastName") = True Then 
 MsgBox "Data was found" 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
