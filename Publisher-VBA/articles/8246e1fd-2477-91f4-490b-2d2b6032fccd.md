# ShapeNode Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform. Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The  **ShapeNode** object is a member of the ** [ShapeNodes](f190a8a8-e03a-e8a2-482a-5e092ff3ed86.md)**collection. The  **ShapeNodes** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.

## Example

Use  **Nodes**(index), where index is the node index number, to return a single  **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on the active document is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape one must be a freeform.


```
Sub ChangeNodeType() 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType Index:=1, EditingType:=msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
