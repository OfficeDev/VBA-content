The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **EditRecord** method to change the value of a single column in a particular record in the master data source (the combined mail-merge recipient list).

Before running this macro, replace  _recordID_ with the index number of the record in the data source that you want to edit; replace _fieldname_ with the name of the field (column) in the record that you want to edit; and replace _value_ with the new value you want to set for the field.




```
Public Sub EditRecord_Example() 
 
 Dim pubMailMergeDataSource As Publisher.MailMergeDataSource 
 
 Set pubMailMergeDataSource = ThisDocument.MailMerge.DataSource 
 
 pubMailMergeDataSource.EditRecord recordID, "fieldname", "value" 
 
End Sub
```
