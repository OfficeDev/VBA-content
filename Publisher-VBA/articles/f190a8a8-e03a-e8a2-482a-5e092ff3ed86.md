# ShapeNodes Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [ShapeNode](8246e1fd-2477-91f4-490b-2d2b6032fccd.md)**objects in the specified freeform. Each  **ShapeNode** object represents either a node between segments in a freeform or a control point for a curved segment of a freeform. You can create a freeform manually or by using the ** [BuildFreeform](ea24a9a2-e72c-beb3-b17d-161ea41fff1d.md)**and  ** [ConvertToShape](1cb490af-40be-b03f-2f8d-04b1015fbde3.md)**methods.

## Example

Use the  ** [Nodes](a1463ff3-5b75-e4b9-df12-985538713c7c.md)**property to return a  **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example deletes node four in shape three on the active document. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform with at least four nodes.


```
Sub DeleteShapeNode() 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3).Nodes.Delete Index:=4 
End Sub
```

Use the  ** [Insert](c78ceefe-db9f-4af0-2e76-2ab1e4dc74b8.md)**method to create a new node and add it to the  **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example adds a smooth node with a curved segment after node four in shape three on the active document. For this example to work, shape three must e a freeform with at least four nodes.




```
Sub AddCurvedSmoothSegment() 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3).Nodes.Insert _ 
 Index:=4, SegmentType:=msoSegmentCurve, _ 
 EditingType:=msoEditingSmooth, X1:=210, Y1:=100 
End Sub
```

Use  **Nodes**(index), where index is the node index number, to return a single  **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on the active document is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.




```
Sub SetPointType() 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType Index:=1, EditingType:=msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
