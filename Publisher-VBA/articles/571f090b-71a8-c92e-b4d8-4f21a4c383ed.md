 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **In this article**
 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, in degrees. Can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates rotation to the left; a negative value indicates rotation to the right. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RotationY**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ThreeDFormat** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis, use the  ** [RotationX](1ee394cb-746b-02f0-f2af-aa4a6fffd172.md)**property of the  **ThreeDFormat** object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the ** [Rotation](3cb55e8c-83fa-2f20-caac-a1e897e9a369.md)**property of the  ** [Shape](666cb7f0-62a8-f419-9838-007ef29506ee.md)**object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the  ** [SetExtrusionDirection](ac01d31d-7775-8e33-3b68-6e53f952fdda.md)**method.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to the active document and sets their rotation around the y-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```
Sub SetRotationY() 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes 
 With .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeOval, Left:=30, _ 
 Top:=120, Width:=50, Height:=25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeOval, Left:=90, _ 
 Top:=120, Width:=50, Height:=25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeOval, Left:=150, _ 
 Top:=120, Width:=50, Height:=25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 30 
 End With 
 End With 
End Sub
```
