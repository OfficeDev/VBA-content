 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  **Long** that represents the scaling of the picture along its vertical axis. The scaling is expressed as a percentage (for example, 200 equals 200 percent scaling). Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **VerticalScale**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PictureFormat** object.


### Return Value

Long


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The effective resolution of a picture is inversely proportional to the scaling at which the picture is printed. The larger the scaling, the lower the effective resolution. For example, suppose a picture measuring 4 inches by 4 inches was originally scanned at 300 dpi. If that picture is scaled to 2 inches by 2 inches, its effective resolution is 600 dpi.

Use the  ** [EffectiveResolution](33e5323f-5e10-b2ed-62eb-03ecbbb1e893.md)** property of the ** [PictureFormat](aa30ea9d-b91f-acdf-2e60-8a9f506f28b4.md)** object to determine the resolution at which the picture or OLE object prints in the specified document.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example prints selected image properties for each picture in the active publication.


```
Dim pgLoop As Page 
Dim shpLoop As Shape 
 
For Each pgLoop In ActiveDocument.Pages 
 For Each shpLoop In pgLoop.Shapes 
 If shpLoop.Type = pbPicture Or shpLoop.Type = pbLinkedPicture Then 
 
 With shpLoop.PictureFormat 
 
 If .IsEmpty = msoFalse Then 
 Debug.Print "File Name: " &amp; .Filename 
 Debug.Print "Resolution in Publication: " &amp; .EffectiveResolution &amp; " dpi" 
 Debug.Print "Horizontal Scaling: " &amp; .HorizontalScale &amp; "%" 
 Debug.Print "Height in publication: " &amp; .Height &amp; " points" 
 Debug.Print "Vertical Scaling: " &amp; .VerticalScale &amp; "%" 
 Debug.Print "Width in publication: " &amp; .Width &amp; " points" 
 End If 
 
 End With 
 End If 
 Next shpLoop 
Next pgLoop 
 

```
