# PageSizes Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the collection of all  **PageSize** objects in the parent **Document** object, where each **PageSize** object represents one of the page sizes available in the current Microsoft Publisher document.

## Remarks

The page sizes represented by the  **PageSizes** collection correspond to the icons displayed under **Blank Page Sizes** in the **Page Setup** dialog box in the Publisher user interface.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **PageSizes** collection to get all the page sizes available in the current document and print the list in the **Immediate** window.


```
Public Sub PageSizes_Example() 
 
 Dim pubPageSizes As Publisher.PageSizes 
 Dim pubPageSize As Publisher.PageSize 
 
 Set pubPageSizes = ThisDocument.PageSetup.AvailablePageSizes 
 For Each pubPageSize In pubPageSizes 
 Debug.Print pubPageSize.Name 
 Next 
 
End Sub
```
