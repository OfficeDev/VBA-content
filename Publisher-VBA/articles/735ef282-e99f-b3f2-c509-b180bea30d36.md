Then set the variable equal to the **Application** object for which you want to access events. For information about using events with the Microsoft Publisher **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](29b60d3c-3049-2ba9-8688-e46c4323e9ba.md).


## Example

This example displays a message before the mail merge process begins, asking the user if they want to continue. If the user clicks No, the merge process is canceled.


```
Private Sub MailMergeApp_MailMergeBeforeMerge(ByVal Doc As Document, _ 
 ByVal StartRecord As Long, ByVal EndRecord As Long, _ 
 Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Dim intVBAnswer As Integer 
 
 Set Doc = ActiveDocument 
 
 'Request whether the user wants to continue with the merge 
 intVBAnswer = MsgBox("Mail Merge for " &amp; Doc.Name &amp; _ 
 " is now starting. Do you want to continue?", _ 
 vbYesNo, "Event!") 
 
 'If user's response to question is No, then cancel merge process 
 'and deliver a message to the user stating the merge is canceled 
 If intVBAnswer = vbNo Then 
 Cancel = True 
 MsgBox "You have canceled mail merge for " &amp; _ 
 Doc.Name &amp; "." 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
