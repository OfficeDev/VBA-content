## Remarks

The following example demonstrates the differences between the  **Path**,  **Name**, and  **FullName** properties. This example is best illustrated if the publication is saved in a folder other than the default.


```
Sub PathNames() 
 
 Dim strPath As String 
 Dim strName As String 
 Dim strFullName As String 
 
 strPath = Application.ActiveDocument.Path 
 strName = Application.ActiveDocument.Name 
 strFullName = Application.ActiveDocument.FullName 
 
 ' Note the file name &amp; path differences 
 ' while executing. 
 MsgBox "The path is: " &amp; strPath 
 MsgBox "The file name is: " &amp; strName 
 MsgBox "The path &amp; file name are: " &amp; strFullName 
 
End Sub 

```
