## Example

The following example adds a rectangle that contains a text frame to the fourth page of the active publication. Some font properties and the text of the text frame are set. A test is then run to determine whether the font in the text frame is Courier. If so, the  ** [Undo](8cfd09a0-8a0d-2870-f833-a35ff1fc21b4.md)** method is used with the value of the ** [UndoActionsAvailable](1dd20295-3987-c36d-ccc1-9e18a7887f33.md)** property passed as a parameter to specify that all previous actions be undone.

The  ** [Redo](4b76aeaa-77f7-5f22-ff80-77479b0f0702.md)** method is then used with the value of the **RedoActionsAvailable** property minus 2 passed as a parameter to redo all actions except for the last two. A new font is specified for the text in the text frame, in addition to new text.

This example assumes the active document contains at least four pages.




```
Dim thePage As page 
Dim theShape As Shape 
Dim theDoc As Publisher.Document 
 
Set theDoc = ActiveDocument 
Set thePage = theDoc.Pages(4) 
 
With theDoc 
 With thePage 
 Set theShape = .Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, _ 
 75, 75, 190, 30) 
 With theShape.TextFrame.TextRange 
 .Font.Size = 12 
 .Font.Name = "Courier" 
 .Text = "This font is Courier." 
 End With 
 End With 
 
 If thePage.Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange.Font.Name = "Courier" Then 
 ' The Undo method specifies that all undoable actions be undone. 
 .Undo (.UndoActionsAvailable) 
 ' The Redo method uses RedoActionsAvailable - 2 to specify that 
 ' all redoable actions be redone except for the last two actions. 
 ' The last two actions that are not redone are setting 
 ' .Font.Name and .Text. 
 .Redo (.RedoActionsAvailable - 2) 
 With theShape.TextFrame.TextRange 
 .Font.Name = "Verdana" 
 .Text = "This font is Verdana." 
 End With 
 End If
