# CellBorder Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the color and weight settings for cell borders.

## Example

Use the various border properties of the  **Cell** object to return the different borders of a cell (left, right, top, bottom, and diagonal). The following example retrieves the top border of the first cell in a table.


```
Dim cbTemp As CellBorder 
 
Set cbTemp = ActiveDocument.Pages(1) _ 
 .Shapes(1).Table.Cells.Item(1).BorderTop
```

Use the  ** [Color](59a43522-f0df-fe1a-6e35-19cb012b103f.md)** and ** [Weight](fb503000-5ca6-c917-ca9f-e3ba28a41114.md)** properties of the **CellBorder** object to format the appearance of a cell border. The following example makes the left border of the first cell in a table red and two points thick.




```
Dim cbTemp As CellBorder 
 
Set cbTemp = ActiveDocument.Pages(1) _ 
 .Shapes(1).Table.Cells.Item(1).BorderLeft 
 
cbTemp.Color.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0) 
cbTemp.Weight = 2
```
