 _expression_A variable that represents an  **LineFormat** object.


### Return Value

MsoTriState


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

An error occurs if you attempt to set this property to  **msoTrue** for any Microsoft Office AutoShape that does not support inset pen drawing.

The value of the  **InsetPen** property for tables is always **msoTrue**; attempting to set the property to any other value results in an error.

The  **InsetPen** property value can be one of the **MsoTriState** constants declared in the Microsoft Office type library and shown in the following table.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **msoFalse**|Lines are drawn directly on the specified shape's boundaries.|
| **msoTriStateMixed**|Return value indicating a combination of  **msoTrue** and **msoFalse** for the specified shape range.|
| **msoTriStateToggle**|Set value that switches between  **msoTrue** and **msoFalse**.|
| **msoTrue**|Lines are drawn inside the specified shape's boundaries.|

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>
