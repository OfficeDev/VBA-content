# Documents Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents all open publications. The  **Documents** collection contains all **Document** objects that are open in Microsoft Publisher.

## Example

Use the  **Documents** property to return the **Documents** collection. The following example lists all of the open publications.


```
Dim objDocument As Document 
Dim strMsg As String 
For Each objDocument In Documents 
 strMsg = strMsg &amp; objDocument.Name &amp; vbCrLf 
Next objDocument 
MsgBox Prompt:=strMsg, Title:="Current Documents Open", Buttons:=vbOKOnly
```

Use the  **Add**method to add a new document to the collection. A new and visible instance of Publisher is created when the  **Add** method is called. The following example adds a new document to the **Documents** collection.




```
Dim objDocument As Document 
Set objDocument = Documents.Add 
With objDocument 
 .LayoutGuides.Columns = 4 
 .LayoutGuides.Rows = 9 
 .ActiveView.Zoom = pbZoomWholePage 
End With
```

Use the  **Item**(index) property, where index is the index number or document name as a  **String**, to return a specific document object. The following example displays the name of the first open publication.




```
If Documents.Count >= 1 Then 
 MsgBox Documents.Item(1).Name 
End If 

```

The following example checks the name of each document in the  **Documents** collection. If the name of a document is "sales.doc", an object variable objSalesDoc is set to that document in the **Documents** collection.




```
Dim objDocument As Document 
Dim objSalesDoc As Document 
For Each objDocument In Documents 
 If objDocument.Name = "sales.pub" Then 
 Set objSalesDoc = objDocument 
 End If 
Next objDocument
```
