 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains properties and methods that apply to WordArt objects.

## Example

Use the  **TextEffect** property to return a **TextEffectFormat** object. The following example sets the font name and formatting for shape one on the first page of the active publication. For this example to work, shape one must be a WordArt object.


```
Sub FormatWordArt() 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).TextEffect 
 .FontName = "Courier New" 
 .FontBold = MsoTrue 
 .FontItalic = MsoTrue 
 End With 
End Sub
```
