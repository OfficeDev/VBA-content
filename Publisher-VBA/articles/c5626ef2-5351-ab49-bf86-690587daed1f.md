 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Decreases the font size to the next available size. If the selection or range contains more than one font size, each size is decreased to the next available setting.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Shrink**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Font** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Applying the  **Shrink** method to text that is already the smallest size allowed by Microsoft Publisher (0.5 point) has no effect.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example inserts a line of increasingly smaller Z's in a new document.


```
Dim shpText As Shape 
Dim trTemp As TextRange 
Dim intCount As Integer 
 
Set shpText = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes _ 
 .AddTextbox(Orientation:=pbTextOrientationHorizontal, _ 
 Left:=100, Top:=100, Width:=300, Height:=50) 
 
Set trTemp = shpText.TextFrame.TextRange 
 
With trTemp 
 .Font.Size = 45 
 .InsertAfter NewText:="ZZZZZZZZZZ" 
 For intCount = 2 To 10 
 .Characters(Start:=intCount, _ 
 Length:=11 - intCount).Font.Shrink 
 Next intCount 
End With
```
