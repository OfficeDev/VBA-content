# ThreeDFormat Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a shape's three-dimensional formatting.

## Remarks

You cannot apply three-dimensional formatting to some kinds of shapes, such as beveled shapes. Most of the properties and methods of the  **ThreeDFormat** object for such a shape will fail.


## Example

Use the  ** [ThreeD](e3430bb2-2f2a-14a6-8eb4-98a29a96ad1c.md)**property to return a  **ThreeDFormat** object. This example sets the depth, extrusion color, extrusion direction, and lighting direction for the 3-D effects applied to shape one in the active publication.


```
Sub SetThreeDSettings() 
 Dim tdfTemp As ThreeDFormat 
 
 Set tdfTemp = _ 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).ThreeD 
 
 With tdfTemp 
 .Visible = True 
 .Depth = 50 
 .ExtrusionColor.RGB = RGB(255, 100, 255) 
 .SetExtrusionDirection _ 
 PresetExtrusionDirection:=msoExtrusionTop 
 .PresetLightingDirection = msoLightingLeft 
 End With 
End Sub
```
