Converts the specified plate from spot color to process.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ConvertToProcess**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Plate** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **ConvertToProcess** method is only accessible if the publication's color mode has been set to process and spot color inks. Use the ** [EnterColorMode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3c04275d-d274-f681-7391-139a54232a3b%28Office.15%29.aspx)** method of the ** [Document](44f02255-ff5b-bcfe-900f-61c8fdf61ef3.md)** object to specify a publication's color mode.

Returns "Permission Denied" when applied to a spot color plate. When the color mode includes process color, the process color inks (black, magenta, yellow and cyan) are the first four plates in the  ** [Plates](7da44b06-c94f-dadc-da91-09b757d5a076.md)** collection.

When a plate is converted from spot to process color, all colors in the publication based on the ink that the converted plate represents are converted to process colors.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example converts the specified spot color plate to process color. The example assumes the publication's color mode has been specified as spot and process color, and that at least six plates have been defined for the publication.


```
Sub ChangePlateToProcess() 
 
 With ActiveDocument.Plates.Item(6) 
 .ConvertToProcess 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
