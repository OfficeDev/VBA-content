# Returning an Object from a Collection (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **Item** method returns a single object from a collection. The following example sets a variable to a ** [Page](9b2e8f29-26c3-1008-0ffd-eea2147abca4.md)** object that represents the first page in the ** [Pages](d6b7262c-015c-dcf3-bff4-0091dd32b78f.md)** collection.



```
Sub SetFirstPage() 
 Dim pgFirst As Page 
 Set pgFirst = ActiveDocument.Pages.Item(1) 
End Sub
```

The  **Item** method is the default method for most collections, so you can write the same statement more concisely by omitting the **Item** keyword.



```
Sub SetFirstPage() 
 Dim pgFirst As Page 
 Set pgFirst = ActiveDocument.Pages(1) 
End Sub
```
