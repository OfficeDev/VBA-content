# MailMergeFilterCriterion Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a filter to be applied to an attached mail merge or catalog merge data source. The  **MailMergeFilterCriterion** object is a member of the **MailMergeFilters** object.

## Example

Each filter is a line in a query string. Use the  ** [Column](000b4b4c-73a1-ea9f-6f44-bc6eac15cb4b.md)**,  ** [Comparison](ba815a39-35d6-803e-39c4-deba30646e66.md)**,  ** [CompareTo](6e81fa38-a5d7-8421-6722-a18c5e9a8229.md)**, and  ** [Conjunction](79365a25-97fd-a18f-7815-eaccf4c5bdca.md)**properties to return or set the data source query criterion. The following example changes an existing filter to remove from the mail merge all records that do not have a Region field equal to "WA". This example assumes that a data source is attached to the active publication.


```
Sub SetQueryCriterion() 
 Dim intItem As Integer 
 With ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Filters 
 For intItem = 1 To .Count 
 With .Item(intItem) 
 If .Column = "Region" Then 
 .Comparison = msoFilterComparisonNotEqual 
 .CompareTo = "WA" 
 If .Conjunction = "Or" Then .Conjunction = "And" 
 End If 
 End With 
 Next 
 End With 
End Sub
```

Use the  ** [Add](ab114dda-d144-7c5f-88b0-930cadcf53db.md)**method of the  **MailMergeFilters** object to add a new filter criterion to the query. This example adds a new line to the query string and then applies the combined filter to the data source. This example assumes that a data source is attached to the active publication.




```
Sub FilterDataSource() 
 With ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource 
 .Filters.Add Column:="Region", _ 
 Comparison:=msoFilterComparisonIsBlank, _ 
 Conjunction:=msoFilterConjunctionAnd 
 .ApplyFilter 
 End With 
End Sub
```
