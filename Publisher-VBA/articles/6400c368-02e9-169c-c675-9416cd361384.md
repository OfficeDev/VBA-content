 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a gridline used to align objects on a page. The  **RulerGuide** object is a member of the ** [RulerGuides](c58d3cb2-8cf8-74fa-2bf4-a931dc95a26a.md)**collection.

## Example

Use the  ** [Add](3986452a-73da-04c2-4e11-8369d61cd974.md)**method of the  **RulerGuides** collection to create a new ruler gridline. Use the ** [Item](e0c49279-4fd4-fe61-636c-c29399fdc404.md)**property to reference a ruler guide. Use the  ** [Position](af169eaf-3cca-0310-c49b-369ba9b2193f.md)**property to change the position of a gridline, and use the  ** [Delete](810f443c-30b9-7ac9-f4d5-349dda8a945c.md)**method to remove a gridline. This example creates a new ruler guide, moves it, and then deletes it.
