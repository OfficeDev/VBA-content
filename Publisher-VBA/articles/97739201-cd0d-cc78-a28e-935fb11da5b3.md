The  **HasAlphaChannel** property value can be one of the **MsoTriState** constants declared in the Microsoft Office type library and shown in the following table.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|

The following example returns whether the first shape on the first page of the active publication contains an alpha channel. If the picture is linked, and the original picture contains an alpha channel, that is also returned. This example assumes the shape is a picture.


```
With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).PictureFormat 
 If .HasAlphaChannel = msoTrue Then 
 Debug.Print .Filename 
 Debug.Print "This picture contains an alpha channel." 
 
 If .IsLinked = msoTrue Then 
 If .OriginalHasAlphaChannel = msoTrue Then 
 Debug.Print "The linked picture " &amp; _ 
 "also contains an alpha channel." 
 End If 
 End If
