# LayoutGuides Object (Publisher)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the measurement grid that appears superimposed on publication pages as an aid to laying out design elements.

## Example

Use the  ** [LayoutGuides](0c45366d-6b7a-7cf3-a566-bb945ff32ba4.md)** property of the **Document** object to return a **LayoutGuides** object. Use the **LayoutGuide** object's margin properties and **Rows** and **Columns** properties to set how many rows and columns are displayed in the layout guides and where they appear on a page.



This example sets the margins of the active presentation to two inches.




```
With ActiveDocument.LayoutGuides 
 .MarginTop = Application.InchesToPoints(Value:=2) 
 .MarginBottom = Application.InchesToPoints(Value:=2) 
 .MarginLeft = Application.InchesToPoints(Value:=2) 
 .MarginRight = Application.InchesToPoints(Value:=2) 
End With
```
