Codes for spatial relationships between shapes to be passed to the  **Shape.SpatialRelation** property.


## Remarks

The spatial relationship between shapes can be indicated by any combination of the following values.



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSpatialContainedIn**|&amp;H4|A shape can be contained within another shape. Shape B is contained within shape A if shape A encloses every region and path of shape B.|
| **visSpatialContain**|&amp;H2|A shape can contain another shape. Shape A contains shape B if shape A encloses every region and path of shape B.|
| **visSpatialOverlap**|&amp;H1|Two shapes can overlap. Shapes overlap if their interior regions have at least one point in common. You will also get this result if you compare a shape to itself or if either shape is a sub-shape of the other.|
| **visSpatialTouching**|&amp;H8|A shape can be touching another shape. Shape A touches shape B if neither one contains or overlaps the other and they have one or more common points whose distance is within the specified tolerance.|
