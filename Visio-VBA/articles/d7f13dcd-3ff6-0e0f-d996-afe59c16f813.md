 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Updates the alignment box for a shape.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **UpdateAlignmentBox**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Selection** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **UpdateAlignmentBox** method alters the width and height of a shape, often a group. For example, after you move a shape in a group, the shape may be outside the group's alignment box. The **UpdateAlignmentBox** method updates the alignment box so that it encloses all the shapes in the group.


 **Note**  Many shapes are designed so that their alignment boxes don't coincide with their geometric extents. Using the  **UpdateAlignmentBox** method on such shapes defeats the intentions of the shape designer.
