### To get information about the object returned by the Vbe property


1. In the  **Code** group on the [Developer](1bdc55f5-8fc7-7257-03d5-c049eceb29ff.md) tab, click **Visual Basic**.
    
2. In the Visual Basic Editor, on the  **Tools** menu, click **References**.
    
3. In the  **References** dialog box, click **Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3**, and then click  **OK**.
    
4. On the  **View** menu, click **Object Browser**.
    
5. In the  **Project/Library** list, select the **VBIDE** type library.
    
6. In the  **Classes** list, examine the class named **VBE**.
    
Beginning with Visio 2002, the  **Vbe** property raises an exception if you are running in a security-enhanced environment and your system administrator has blocked access to the VBA object model. There is no user interface or programmatic way to turn this onâ€”the system administrator must turn on (or off) access by setting a Group Policy. This helps protect against viruses that spread by accessing the Visual Basic projects in commonly used templates and injecting the virus code into them.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This VBA macro shows how to use the  **Vbe** property to determine how many VBA projects are open in an instance of Visio.

Before running this code, make sure the  **Trust access to the VBA project object model** check box is selected under **Developer Macro Settings** on the **Macro Settings** page of the **Trust Center** dialog box (click the **File** tab, click **Options**, click  **Trust Center**, and then click  **Trust Center Settings**). 




```
 
Public Sub Vbe_Example() 
 
     Dim vbideVBE As VBIDE.VBE 
 
     Set vbideVBE = Visio.Application.Vbe 
     Debug.Print vbideVBE.VBProjects.Count 
 
End Sub 

```
