 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Represents a layer of a page or master. You can assign shapes to or remove them from the layer.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **Layer** object is **Name**.

To access cells whose values define layer attributes, such as whether the layer is visible or printable, use the  **CellsC** property.

A layer's  **Index** and **Row** properties typically have different values. The **Index** property indicates the layer's ordinal position in its **Layers** collection. The layer's **Row** property indicates the index of the row in the Layers section where the layer's attributes are defined.
