# Window Object (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Represents an open window in a Microsoft Visio instance.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **Window** object is **Application**.

To retrieve


- the active window in an instance of Visio, use the  **ActiveWindow** property of an **Application** object.
    
- a  **Page** object that represents the page shown in the window, use the **Page** property of a **Window** object.
    
- a  **Document** object that represents the document displayed in that window, use the **Document** property.
    
- a  **Selection** object that represents the shapes selected in that window, use the **Selection** property.
    

 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Visio 2002, the following methods of the  **Window** object are obsolete: **AddToGroup**,  **Cut**,  **Combine**,  **Copy**,  **Delete**,  **Duplicate**,  **Fragment**,  **Group**,  **Intersect**,  **Join RemoveFromGroup**,  **Subtract**,  **Trim**, and  **Union**. Existing solutions that invoke these methods will continue to work properly; however, new or rebuilt solutions should use these methods with the  **Selection** object.

In addition, the  **Window** object's **Paste** method is now obsolete. Use the **Paste** or **PasteSpecial** method of the **Page**,  **Master**, or  **Shape** object. (Use the **Shape** object in the case of group shapes.)
