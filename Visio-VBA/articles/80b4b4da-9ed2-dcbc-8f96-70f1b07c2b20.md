 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **GraphicItem** object is ** [ID](1124979f-ad9c-8466-fab9-d780569e668b.md)**.

 **GraphicItem** objects can be of four types:




- Color by value
    
- Data bar
    
- Icon set
    
- Text callout
    


You cannot create or significantly modify  **GraphicItem** objects programmaticallyâ€”you must perform these tasks in the Visio user interface (UI). For more information about creating and modifying data graphics in the UI, search for "data graphic" in Visio end-user Help.

However, the properties and methods listed below do permit some programmatic modification of  **GraphicItem** objects. In particular, you can modify the position of a graphic item relative to the shape or selection it's associated with; the Z-order (the order in which Visio draws graphic items) of a **GraphicItem** object in the ** [GraphicItems](89d0bbeb-ee45-50cc-490e-0af49d036ad1.md)** collection; and the expression (value) used to evaluate a graphic item against the rule that determines how it is displayed.

Use the  ** [DataGraphic](af50de40-5f88-d32d-5fbe-c3295cc2925f.md)** property to get the **Master** object of type **visTypeDataGraphic** that contains the **GraphicItem** object.

Use the  ** [GetExpression](61864d97-a61b-549a-6f41-d741c19a330f.md)** method to get the current expression against which the graphic item's rule is evaluated.

Use the  ** [SetExpression](e0fd9a38-1fc0-3189-9def-64f2c181951d.md)** method to set the current expression against which the graphic item's rule is evaluated.

Use the  ** [Delete](cd395089-594a-a021-0455-5bd7de9c3468.md)** method to delete a **GraphicItem** object from the ** [GraphicItems](89d0bbeb-ee45-50cc-490e-0af49d036ad1.md)** collection.

Use the  ** [HorizontalPosition](268c461f-0290-3e3b-98f4-fa15bc902fa6.md)** property to get or set the horizontal position of the graphic item relative to the shape or selection that it's associated with.

Use the  ** [VerticalPosition](a756df97-851d-c6cf-b68f-b84e07da8628.md)** property to get or set thevertical position of the graphic item relative to the shape or selection that it's associated with.

Use the  ** [UseDataGraphicPosition](d463eefb-8103-3701-fd8a-604c65f74713.md)** property to get or set whether a **GraphicItem** object inherits the settings of the ** [DataGraphicHorizontalPosition](d9c98a41-ffc0-152e-2150-0915bd38bcac.md)** and ** [DataGraphicVerticalPosition](779f360e-7529-7fe6-87e7-f41cc9334c83.md)** properties of the data graphic master it belongs to (when set to **True)**, or whether the  **GraphicItem** object's own **HorizontalPosition** and **Vertical Position** settings are applied (when set to **False**).
