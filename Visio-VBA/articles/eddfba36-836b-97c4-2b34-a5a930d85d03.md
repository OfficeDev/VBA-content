## Syntax

 _expression_. **DisplayName**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **DataColumn** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

The  **DisplayName** property value is not necessarily the same as that of the ** [Name](9b66e7b1-f3e7-af3a-8a64-59ab90fd6119.md)** property, which is read-only, and which determines the unique identifier of the data column in its parent data recordset.

The value of the  **DisplayName** property corresponds to the value in the Label column in the Shape Data section of the ShapeSheet spreadsheet of a shape that is linked to data. The Label column value determines the label that appears for a particular shape-data item in the **Shape Data** dialog box for that shape. (Right-click the shape, and then click **Shape Data**.)


 **Note**  In some previous versions of Visio, Shape Data were called Custom Properties.
