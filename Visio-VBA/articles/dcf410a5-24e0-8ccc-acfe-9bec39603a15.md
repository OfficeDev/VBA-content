# Menu.AddOnArgs Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Gets or sets the argument string that you send to the add-on associated with a particular menu. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AddOnArgs**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Menu** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

An argument's string can be anything appropriate for the add-on. However, the arguments are packaged together with other information into a command string, which cannot exceed 127 characters. For best results, limit arguments to 50 characters.

An object's  **AddOnName** property indicates the name of the add-on to which the arguments are sent.

 Beginning with Visio 2002, the **AddOnName** property used in the following example cannot execute a string that contains arbitrary Microsoft Visual Basic code. To call code that in previous versions of Visio you would have passed to the **AddOnName** property, move it to a procedure in a document's Visual Basic project that is called from the **AddOnName** property, as shown in the following example.
