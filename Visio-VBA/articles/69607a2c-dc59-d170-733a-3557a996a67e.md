```vb
 
Public Sub Close_Example() 
 Dim intCounter As Integer 
 intCounter = Windows.Count 
 
 'Close all ShapeSheet windows that are open. 
 While intCounter <> 0 
 If Windows(intCounter).Type = visSheet Then 
 Windows(intCounter).Close 
 intCounter = Windows.Count 
 Else 
 intCounter = intCounter - 1 
 End If 
 Wend 
End Sub
```
