Occurs after a document is saved.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

Private Sub  _expression__**DocumentSaved**( **_ByVal doc As [IVDOCUMENT]_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|

|doc|Required| **[IVDOCUMENT]**|The document that was saved.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example shows how to create a class module to handle events fired by a source object in Microsoft Visio, for example, the  **Document** object. The module consists of the function **VisEventProc**, which uses a  **Select Case** block to check for three events: **DocumentSaved**,  **PageAdded**, and  **ShapesDeleted**. Other events fall under the default case ( **Case Else**). Each  **Case** block constructs a string ( _strMessage_) that contains the name and event code of the event that fired. Finally, the function displays the string in the Immediate window.

Copy this sample code into a new class module in VBA or Visual Basic, naming the module  **clsEventSink**. You can then use an event-sink module to create an instance of the  **clsEventSink** class and **Event** objects that send notifications of event firings to the class instance. To see how to create an event-sink module, refer to the example for the **AddAdvise** method.




```
 
Implements Visio.IVisEventProc 
 
'Declare visEvtAdd as a 2-byte value 
'to avoid a run-time overflow error 
Private Const visEvtAdd% = &amp;H8000 
 
Private Function IVisEventProc_VisEventProc( _ 
 ByVal nEventCode As Integer, _ 
 ByVal pSourceObj As Object, _ 
 ByVal nEventID As Long, _ 
 ByVal nEventSeqNum As Long, _ 
 ByVal pSubjectObj As Object, _ 
 ByVal vMoreInfo As Variant) As Variant 
 
 Dim strMessage As String 
 
 'Find out which event fired 
 Select Case nEventCode 
 Case visEvtCodeDocSave 
 strMessage = "DocumentSaved (" &amp; nEventCode &amp; ")" 
 Case (visEvtPage + visEvtAdd) 
 strMessage = "PageAdded (" &amp; nEventCode &amp; ")" 
 Case visEvtCodeShapeDelete 
 strMessage = "ShapesDeleted(" &amp; nEventCode &amp; ")" 
 Case Else 
 strMessage = "Other (" &amp; nEventCode &amp; ")" 
 End Select 
 
 'Display the event name and the event code 
 Debug.Print strMessage 
 
End Function
