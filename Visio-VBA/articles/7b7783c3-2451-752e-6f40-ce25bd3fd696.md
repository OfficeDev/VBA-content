# Event.Event Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Gets or sets the event code of an  **Event** objectâ€”an event-action pair. When the event occurs, the action is performed. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Event**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Event** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks

If the action code of the  **Event** object is **visActCodeRunAddon**, the event also specifies the target of the action and the arguments to send to the target. This information is stored in the  **Target** and **TargetArgs** properties, respectively.

If the action code of the  **Event** object is **visActCodeAdvise**, the event also specifies the object to receive event notifications (sometimes called the sink object) and arguments to send to the sink object along with the notification.

Event codes are declared by the Microsoft Visio type library in  ** [VisEventCodes](e6f205ab-803a-4d91-fa8a-0952bb9753cf.md)**. They are prefixed with " **visEvt**". For a list of event codes, see  [Event Codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).

A program can use the  **Trigger** method to cause an **Event** object's action to be performed without waiting for the event to occur.
