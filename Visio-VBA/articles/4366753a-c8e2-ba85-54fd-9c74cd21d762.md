## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CalloutTarget**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Shape](da7a8872-4ebb-a607-e0ed-eebf68ff5630.md)** object.


### Return Value

 **Shape**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you attempt to get or set the  **CalloutTarget** property value on a shape that is not a callout, Microsoft Visio will return an **Inappropriate Source Object** error.

If no target shape is associated with the callout shape, the  **CalloutTarget** property returns **Nothing**. Setting the property value to  **Nothing** removes any target shapes that are associated with the callout shape.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example shows how to use the  **CalloutTarget** property to set the target shape of a callout.


```
Set vsoShape = vsoCalloutShape.CalloutTarget
```
