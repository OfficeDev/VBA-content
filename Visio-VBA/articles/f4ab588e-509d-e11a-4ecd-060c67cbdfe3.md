If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  ** [Event](f11fffff-2218-8cc4-f223-31d956d1252d.md)** objects, use the ** [EventList.Add](4deacea0-f4dc-bec6-31d0-bb9a060812f5.md)** or ** [EventList.AddAdvise](b58e086f-59d2-9e63-5df3-3001b58bb2c1.md)** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **EventList.Add** method. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **EventList.AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event Codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).
