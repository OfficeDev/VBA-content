 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Gets or sets the command ID associated with a menu item. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **CmdNum**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **MenuItem** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

When the  **AddOnName** property of a **MenuItem** object indicates an add-on to run, Microsoft Visio automatically assigns a **CmdNum** property.

To insert a separator in a menu preceding a  **MenuItem** object, use the **BeginGroup** property.

Valid command IDs are declared by the Visio type library in  ** [VisUICmds](b956d178-eb19-5b64-189f-8bc774860758.md)**. They have the prefix  **visCmd**.
