# InvisibleApp.DeferRelationshipRecalc Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Determines whether Microsoft Visio defers recalculating shape sizes and relationships when a member of a relationship pair is moved or resized. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DeferRelationshipRecalc**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  ** [InvisibleApp](70a30571-2017-af8b-eaa1-bf93c758a46a.md)** object.


### Return Value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

For example, if you resize a shape that is a member of a container in a structured diagram, Visio will not adjust the size of the container if  **DeferRelationshipRecalc** is **True**. When you set  **DeferRelationshipRecalc** to **False**, Visio recalculates the container size and adjusts it accordingly. (In each case, the container's  ** [ResizeAsNeeded](13bd0493-95fd-73bf-454c-a39c69589bcd.md)** property must be set to **visContainerAutoResizeExpandContract**.)

Setting  **DeferRelationshipRecalc** to **False** causes Visio to immediately process all deferred actions.
