# Global Object (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

The Microsoft Visio global object is automatically available to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code that is part of the VBA project of a Visio document. The Visio global object is not available to code in other contexts.


## Remarks

Members of the global object can be accessed without qualification. For example, to access the  **ActivePage** member of the global object:


```
    Set vsoPage = ActivePage 
```

The preceding syntax is different from the syntax you would use for accessing members of non-global objects. For example:




```
    Set vsoPage = vsoApplication.ActivePage
```


 **Note**  The VBA project of every Visio document also has a class module called  **ThisDocument**. When referenced from code in the VBA project, the  **ThisDocument** module returns a reference to the project's **Document** object.
