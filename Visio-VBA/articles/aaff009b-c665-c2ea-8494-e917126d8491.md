# Characters Object (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Represents a shape's text with the text fields expanded to the number of characters they display in a drawing window.


## Remarks

To retrieve a  **Characters** object, use the **Characters** property of a **Shape** object.

The default property of a  **Characters** object is **Text**.

The  **Begin** and **End** properties of a **Characters** object determine the range of the shape's text that is represented by the **Characters** object. Initially, the range contains all of the shape's text; you can set the **Begin** and **End** properties to specify a subrange of the text.

After you retrieve a  **Characters** object, you can use its **Text** property to retrieve or set the shape's text. Use the **Copy**,  **Cut**, or  **Paste** method to copy, cut, or paste the **Characters** object's text to or from the Clipboard. Use the **CharProps** or **ParaProps** property to change the **Characters** object's formatting.

If your Visual Studio solution includes the  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio** reference, this object maps to the following types:


-  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio.IVCharacters**
