## Remarks

If you are creating an undo unit for your solution, the  **Do** method is one of the procedures that you must implement. It provides the actions that are required to undo and redo actions.

 If you are creating a single object for both undoing and redoing, the **Do** method maintains the undo/redo state and adds an undo unit to the opposite stack.

If the  **Do** method is passed a **Nothing** pointer, the unit should carry out the undo action but should not place anything on the undo or redo stack.

For more information about the  **Do** method and using the **IVBUndoUnit** interface to create undo units, search for "creating undo units" on MSDN.
