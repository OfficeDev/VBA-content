 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Represents a subset of  **Shape** objects for a page or master to which an operation can be applied.


## Remarks

To retrieve a  **Selection** object that corresponds to the set of shapes selected in a window, use the **Selection** property of a **Window** object.

The default property of a  **Selection** object is **Item**.

After you retrieve a  **Selection** object, you can add or remove shapes by using the **Select** method.

By default, the items reported by a  **Selection** object do not include subselected or superselected **Shape** objects. Use the **IterationMode** property to control whether subselected and superselected **Shape** objects are reported. You can determine whether an individual item is subselected or superselected by using the **ItemStatus** property.
