 _expression_. **Close**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Window** object.

## Remarks

If the indicated window is the only window open for a document and the document contains unsaved changes, an alert appears asking if you want to save the document. You can use the  **AlertResponse** property to prevent the alert from appearing.

If you close a docked stencil window, only that window is closed. However, if you close a drawing window that contains docked stencils, the docked stencil window is also closed.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example shows how to close all open ShapeSheet windows. It assumes at least one ShapeSheet window is open in Microsoft Visio.


```
 
Public Sub Close_Example() 
 Dim intCounter As Integer 
 intCounter = Windows.Count 
 
 'Close all ShapeSheet windows that are open. 
 While intCounter <> 0 
 If Windows(intCounter).Type = visSheet Then 
 Windows(intCounter).Close 
 intCounter = Windows.Count 
 Else 
 intCounter = intCounter - 1 
 End If 
 Wend 
End Sub 

```
