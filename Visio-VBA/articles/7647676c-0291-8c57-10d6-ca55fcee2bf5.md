 _expression_An expression that returns a  **DataRecordset** object.


### Return Value

## Remarks

Constants for how a data recordset is refreshed are declared in the  **VisRefreshSettings** enumeration in the Visio type library:



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visRefreshNoReconciliationUI**|2|Disables the  **Refresh Conflicts** task pane in the Visio user interface (UI) after a refresh operation.|
| **visRefreshOverwriteAll**|1|When data is refreshed, overwrites all user changes made in the shape data of shapes linked to data in this recordset since the previous refresh operation. See note.|
The default is for neither of the  **VisRefreshSettings** flags to be turned on. ( **RefreshSettings** = 0).

When  **visRefreshNoReconciliationUI** is set, support for reconciling refresh conflicts in the Visio UI is disabled. As a developer, you should reconcile refresh conflicts programmatically by using the ** [GetAllRefreshConflicts](96d1c866-6c0d-f750-46a8-8257340ebd71.md)**,  ** [GetMatchingRowsForRefreshConflict](07526278-19db-ccbc-6785-095c73128879.md)**, and  ** [RemoveRefreshConflict](a92abdb7-f47c-b843-cacf-6acca68d9c66.md)** methods.


 **Note**  In some previous versions of Visio, shape data was called custom properties.
