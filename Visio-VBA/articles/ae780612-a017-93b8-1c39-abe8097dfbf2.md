## Remarks

The  **message** property corresponds to the **message** member of the **MSG** structure defined as part of the Microsoft Windows operating system. If an event handler is handling the **OnKeystrokeMessageForAddon** event, Microsoft Visio passes a **MSGWrap** object as an argument when this event fires. A **MSGWrap** object is a wrapper around the Windows **MSG** structure.

The  **OnKeystrokeMessageForAddon** event fires for messages in the following range:



|WM_KEYDOWN|0x0100|
|WM_KEYUP |0x0101 |
|WM_CHAR |0x0102 |
|WM_DEADCHAR |0x0103 |
|WM_SYSKEYDOWN |0x0104 |
|WM_SYSKEYUP |0x0105 |
|WM_SYSCHAR |0x0106 |
|WM_SYSDEADCHAR |0x0107 |
