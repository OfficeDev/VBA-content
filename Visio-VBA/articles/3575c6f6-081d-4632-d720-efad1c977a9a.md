 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Passed by Microsoft Visio as the pSubjectObj argument to the  ** [VisEventProc](d5a33174-4dcb-8afd-991c-eb59ddb2ea2d.md)** method of the ** [IVisEventProc](332ec60d-c70a-9d7f-15ad-bb797f60b3a5.md)** interface when events related to refreshing a data recordset fire.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Remarks

To handle event notifications in Visio, create a class module that implements the  **IVisEventProc** interface in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or Microsoft Visual Basic, and then create an instance of this class to pass as an argument to the ** [AddAdvise](b58e086f-59d2-9e63-5df3-3001b58bb2c1.md)** method of the ** [EventList](08b70863-ce73-2cd2-ccc0-a993bd261ea2.md)** collection.

When data recordset rows are added, changed, or deleted, and when data recordset columns are added or deleted, in each case as a result of a data recordset being refreshed, properties of the  **DataRecordsetChangedEvent** object that is passed to the **VisEventProc** method return arrays of the affected rows or columns.

All properties of the  **DataRecordsetChangedEvent** object are read-only.
