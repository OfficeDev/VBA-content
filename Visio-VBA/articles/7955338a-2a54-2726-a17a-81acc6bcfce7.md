## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SelectedValidationIssue**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Window](5b49eb0f-07ea-00c7-52f1-2a3115a4b8ae.md)** object.


### Return Value

 [ValidationIssue](b1e93738-48da-cf68-24ad-dd03f79ad152.md)


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Attempting to get or set the  **SelectedValidationIssue** property on a window other than the **Issues** window, or when the **Issues** window is closed, returns an error.

If multiple issues are selected in the  **Issues** window, Visio returns the issue that has the focus.

If no issue is selected, Visio returns  **Nothing**. By default, issues that you have specified to be ignored are not displayed. If you set the property to  **Nothing**, Visio clears the selection in the  **Issues** window.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example shows how to use the  **SelectedValidationIssue** property to get the validation issue that is currently selected in the **Issues** window. If no issue is selected, the code displays a message box prompting the user to select an issue.


```
Set vsoIssuesWindow = Application.ActiveWindow.Windows.ItemFromID(Visio.VisWinTypes.visWinIDValidationIssues)
    
' If the Issues window is visible, find the selected validation issue.
    If vsoIssuesWindow.Visible Then
       Set vsoValidationIssue = vsoIssuesWindow.SelectedValidationIssue
    End If
    
' Respond to the case when no validation issue is selected. 
    If vsoValidationIssue Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "Please select an issue."
    End If
```
