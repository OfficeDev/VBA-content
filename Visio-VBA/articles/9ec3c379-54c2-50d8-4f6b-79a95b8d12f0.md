Includes a  **Shape** object for each basic shape, group, guide, or object from another application (linked or embedded in Microsoft Visio) on a drawing page, master, or group.


## Remarks

To retrieve a  **Shapes** collection, use the **Shapes** property of a **Page**,  **Master**, or  **Shape** object.

The default property of a  **Shapes** collection is **Item**.

The order of items in a  **Shapes** collection corresponds to the stacking (drawing) order of the shapes.

If your Visual Studio solution includes the  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio** reference, this collection maps to the following types:


-  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio.IVShapes**
