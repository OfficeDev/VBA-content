# Cell Object (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Holds a formula that evaluates to some value.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **Cell** object is **ResultIU**.

You can get or set a cell's formula or value. A cell belongs to a  **Shape**,  **Style**, or  **Row** object and represents a property of the shape, style, or row. For example, the height of a shape equals the value of the shape's Height cell.

A program can control a shape's appearance and behavior by working with the formulas in the shape's cells. You can visually inspect most of a shape's cells by opening the shape's ShapeSheet window. Use the  **Cells** or **CellsSRC** property of a **Shape** object to retrieve a **Cell** object. To retrieve a cell in a style, use the **Cells** property of a **Style** object.
