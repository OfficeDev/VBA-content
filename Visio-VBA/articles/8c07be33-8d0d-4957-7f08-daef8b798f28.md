 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

Occurs after the value changes in a cell in a document.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

Private Sub  _expression__**CellChanged**( **_ByVal Cell As [IVCELL]_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|

|Cell|Required| **[IVCELL]**|The cell whose value has changed.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](de8f5c7a-421d-ebcf-22b6-4310a202ef64.md).




 **Note**  You can use VBA  **WithEvents** variables to sink the **CellChanged** event.

For performance considerations, the  **Document** object's event set does not include the **CellChanged** event. To sink the **CellChanged** event from a **Document** object (and the **ThisDocument** object in a VBA project), you must use the **AddAdvise** method.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This VBA module shows how to use the  **CellChanged** event to trap changes to a shape's cells.


```
 
Private WithEvents vsoApplication As Visio.Application 
 
Public Sub CellChanged_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
 
 'Set a module-level variable to trap application-level events. 
 Set vsoApplication = Application 
 
 'Draw a shape. 
 Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(1, 2, 2, 1) 
 
 'Change a cell (to trigger a CellChanged event). 
 vsoShape.Cells("Width").Formula = 5 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_CellChanged(ByVal vsoCell As IVCell) 
 
 Debug.Print vsoCell.Shape.Name &amp; " " &amp; vsoCell.Name &amp; " changed to =" &amp; vsoCell.Formula 
 
End Sub 

```
