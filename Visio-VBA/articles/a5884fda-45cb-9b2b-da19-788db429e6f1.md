 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns the shape to which one or more connections are made. Read-only.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ToSheet**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Connects** object.


### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **ToSheet** property for a **Connect** object always returns the shape to which the connection is made.

The  **Connects** collection represents several connections. If every connection represented by the collection is made to the same shape, the **ToSheet** property returns that shape. Otherwise, it returns **Nothing** and does not raise an exception.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **ToSheet** property to find the shape a **Connect** object originates from in a Microsoft Visio drawing. The example displays the connection information in the Immediate window.

This example assumes there is an active document that contains at least two connected shapes. For best results, connect two shapes from the  **Organization Chart Shapes** stencil.
