 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

## Syntax

 _expression_. **LiveDynamics**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **InvisibleApp** object.


### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks

The  **LiveDynamics** property tracks actions, such as resizing and rotating shapes, and is effective when shapes are glued or related to each other. When the value of the **LiveDynamics** property is **True**, more events such as  **CellChanged** occur. Solutions that respond to such events may operate more quickly if the **LiveDynamics** property is set to **False**.
