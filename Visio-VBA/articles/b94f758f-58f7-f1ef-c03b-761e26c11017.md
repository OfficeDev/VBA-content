# ContainerProperties Object (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Represents the set of properties that are specific to a container.


## Remarks

A container is a shape that has some specific properties that are represented conceptually by a  **ContainerProperties** object. Containers appear as collections of shapes surrounded by borders that are sometimes, but not always, visible. Some, but not all, containers are lists.

You can use the  ** [Shape.ContainerProperties](bc375912-f624-dbdc-3b02-2edf3bf5d8a2.md)** property to get a **ContainerProperties** object that represents the set of container properties of any shape, whether or not it is actually a container.

To create an instance of a container shape on the drawing page, use the  ** [Page.DropContainer](14da134d-6a3f-25c3-37c4-eb8b51c213ab.md)** method.
