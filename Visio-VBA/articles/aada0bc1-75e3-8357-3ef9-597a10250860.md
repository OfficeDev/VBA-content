# Shape.Parent Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Determines the parent of a  **Shape** object. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Parent**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Return Value

Object


## Remarks

In general, an object's parent is the object that contains it. If a  **Shape** object is a member of a group, the parent is that group. Otherwise, its parent is a **Page** or a **Master** object.

When assigning a new parent shape, you must assign a  **Shape** object. If you want to assign a page or master to be the parent of a shape, you must assign the **Shape** object returned by the **Page** or **Master** object's **PageSheet** property.

A shape and its parent shape must be in the same containing page or containing master. If the new parent is not a  **Shape** object, or if the **ContainingPage** or **ContainingMaster** property of the parent shape is different from that of the shape, Microsoft Visio raises an exception.
