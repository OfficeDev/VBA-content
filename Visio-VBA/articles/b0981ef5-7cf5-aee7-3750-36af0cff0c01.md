# Application Members (Visio)
Represents an instance of Visio. An external program typically creates or retrieves an  **Application** object before it can retrieve other Visio objects from that instance. Use the Microsoft Visual Basic **CreateObject** function or the **New** keyword to run a new instance, or use the **GetObject** function to retrieve an instance that is already running. You can also use the **CreateObject** function with the **InvisibleApp** object to run a new instance that is invisible. Set the value of the **InvisibleApp** object's **Visible** property to **True** to show it.
