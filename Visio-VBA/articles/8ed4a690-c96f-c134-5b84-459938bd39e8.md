 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelectedDataRowID**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Window** object.


### Return Value

Long


## Remarks

The  **SelectedDataRowID** property works only when the **Window** object represents the **External Data Window**. Calling the property on any other window type results in an error. The  **External Data Window** must already be displayed in the Visio UI before you call **SelectedDataRowID**.

Setting  **SelectedDataRowID** clears the current selection and sets the selection to the row you specify.

If multiple rows are selected when you get  **SelectedDataRowID**, the property returns the ID of the row that has the focus.
