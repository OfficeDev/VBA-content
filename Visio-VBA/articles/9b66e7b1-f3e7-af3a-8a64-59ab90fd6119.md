Gets the unique name of the data column in its parent data recordset. Read-only.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Name**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DataColumn** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

The  **Name** property is the default property of the **DataColumn** object. The value of **Name** is unique within a particular data recordset and therefore uniquely identifies the column in the data recordset. The value that Visio assigns for the **Name** property is the same as, or derived from, the name of the column in the original data source.

For a given column, the value of the  **Name** property is not necessarily the same as that of the ** [DisplayName](eddfba36-836b-97c4-2b34-a5a930d85d03.md)** property, which specifies the name of the column in the **External Data** window in the Visio user interface, and which is read/write.
