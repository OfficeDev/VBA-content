 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


 Returns the **Page** object that represents the original Microsoft Visio drawing page that was marked up on separate markup overlays by reviewers of the drawing. Read-only.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **OriginalPage**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Page** object.


### Return Value

Page


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the  **Page** parent object is not a markup overlay, **OriginalPage** returns an error. To determine if a page is a markup overlay, check to see whether **Page.Type** = **visTypeMarkup** (3).

When a user clicks  **Track Markup**, Visio creates a new page of type  **visTypeMarkup**. The original page has type  **visTypeForeground** or **visTypeBackground**. Each markup overlay is associated with a unique original drawing page.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro uses the  **OriginalPage** property to get the name of the original page that was marked up on a markup overlay and display it in the Immediate window. Before running this macro, make sure that a drawing page is displayed in the active window.


```
Public Sub OriginalPage_Example() 
 
 'Turn on Track Markup to make a markup overlay the active page. 
 Application.ActiveDocument.DocumentSheet.CellsSRC(visSectionObject, visRowDoc, visDocAddMarkup).FormulaU = True 
 
 'Display the name of the original page that currently is being marked up. 
 Debug.Print ActivePage.OriginalPage.Name 
 
End Sub 

```
