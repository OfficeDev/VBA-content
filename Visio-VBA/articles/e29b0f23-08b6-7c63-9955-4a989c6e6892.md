# MovedSelectionEvent Object (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Holds information about a selection that is moved from one location, such as a page or a document, to another.


## Remarks

When you move a selection of shapes to a sub-process page, Microsoft Visio fires the  **SelectionMovedToSubprocess**event ( ** [AddAdvise](b58e086f-59d2-9e63-5df3-3001b58bb2c1.md)**-only), which returns a  **MovedSelectionEvent** object that encapsulates information about the move.
