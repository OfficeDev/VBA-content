# InvisibleApp.IsInScope Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

 **In this article**
 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Determines whether a call to an event handler is between an  **EnterScope** event and an **ExitScope** event for a scope. Read-only.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **IsInScope**( **_nCmdID_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **InvisibleApp** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|nCmdID|Required| **Long**|The scope ID.|

### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Constants representing scope IDs are prefixed with  **visCmd** and are declared by the Visio type library. You can also use an ID returned by the **BeginUndoScope** method.

You could use this property in a  **CellChanged** event handler to determine whether a cell change was the result of a particular operation.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example shows how to use the  **IsInScope** property to determine whether a call to a procedure that handles the **CellChanged** event is in a particular scopeâ€”that is, whether the call occurs between the **EnterScope** and **ExitScope** events for that scope.


```
 
Private WithEvents vsoApplication As Visio.Application 
Private lngScopeID As Long 
 
Public Sub IsInScope_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
 
 'Set the module-level application variable to 
 'trap application-level events. 
 Set vsoApplication = Application 
 
 'Begin a scope. 
 lngScopeID = Application.BeginUndoScope("Draw Shapes") 
 
 'Draw three shapes. 
 Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(1, 2, 2, 1) 
 ActivePage.DrawOval 3, 4, 4, 3 
 ActivePage.DrawLine 4, 5, 5, 4 
 
 'Change a cell (to trigger the CellChanged event). 
 vsoShape.Cells("Width").Formula = 5 
 
 'End and commit this scope. 
 Application.EndUndoScope lngScopeID, True 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_CellChanged(ByVal Cell As IVCell) 
 
 'Check to see if this cell change is the result of something 
 'happening within the scope. 
 If vsoApplication.IsInScope(lngScopeID) Then 
 Debug.Print Cell.Name &amp; " changed in scope "; lngScopeID 
 End If 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_EnterScope(ByVal app As IVApplication, _ 
 ByVal nScopeID As Long, _ 
 ByVal bstrDescription As String) 
 
 If vsoApplication.CurrentScope = lngScopeID Then 
 Debug.Print "Entering my scope " &amp; nScopeID 
 Else 
 Debug.Print "Enter Scope " &amp; bstrDescription &amp; "(" &amp; nScopeID &amp; ")" 
 End If 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_ExitScope(ByVal app As IVApplication, _ 
 ByVal nScopeID As Long, _ 
 ByVal bstrDescription As String, _ 
 ByVal bErrOrCancelled As Boolean) 
 
 If vsoApplication.CurrentScope = lngScopeID Then 
 Debug.Print "Exiting my scope " &amp; nScopeID 
 Else 
 Debug.Print "ExitScope " &amp; bstrDescription &amp; "(" &amp; nScopeID &amp; ")" 
 End If 
 
End Sub
