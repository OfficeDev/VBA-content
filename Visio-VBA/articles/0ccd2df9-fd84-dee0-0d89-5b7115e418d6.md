 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Picture**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Return Value

IPictureDisp


## Remarks

The  **Picture** property returns only EMF files.

COM provides a standard implementation of a picture object that has the  **IPictureDisp** interface on top of the underlying system picture support. The **IPictureDisp** interface exposes a picture object's properties and is implemented in the **stdole** type library as a **StdPicture** object creatable within Microsoft Visual Basic. The **stdole** type library is automatically referenced from all Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) projects in Microsoft Visio.

Currently, only in-process solutions can use the  **Picture** property because the **IPictureDisp** interface cannot be marshaled.


### To get information about the StdPicture object that supports the IPictureDisp interface
