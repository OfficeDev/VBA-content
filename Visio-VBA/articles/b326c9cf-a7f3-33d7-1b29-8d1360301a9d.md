Converts a string or number into an equivalent number in different measurement units.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ConvertResult**( **_StringOrNumber_**,  **_UnitsIn_**,  **_UnitsOut_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|StringOrNumber|Required| **Variant**|String or number to be converted; can be a string, floating point number, or integer.|
|UnitsIn|Required| **Variant**|Measurement units to attribute to StringOrNumber.|
|UnitsOut|Required| **Variant**|Measurement units to express the result in.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If passed as a string, StringOrNumber might be the formula or prospective formula of a cell or the result or prospective result of a cell expressed as a string. The **ConvertResult** method evaluates the string and converts the result into the units designated byUnitsOut. The  **ConvertResult** method returns an error if the string contains any cell references.

Possible values for StringOrNumber include:

1.7

3

"2.5"

"4.1 cm"

"12 ft - 17 in + (12 cm / SQRT(7))"

The UnitsIn andUnitsOut arguments can be strings such as "inches", "inch", "in.", or "i". Strings may be used for all supported Microsoft Office Visio units such as centimeters, meters, miles, and so on. You can also use any of the units constants declared by the Visio type library in **VisUnitCodes**. A list of valid units is also listed in  [About Units of Measure](b6140312-b8e6-0cf2-9fe0-b14e800216bf.md).

If StringOrNumber is a floating point number or integer,UnitsIn declares what unit of measure the **ConvertResult** method should construe the number to be. Pass "" to indicate internal Visio units.

If StringOrNumber is a string,UnitsIn specifies how to interpret the evaluated result and is only used if the result is a scalar. For example, the expression "4 * 5 cm" evaluates to 20 cm, which is not a scalar, soUnitsIn is ignored. The expression "4 * 5" evaluates to 20 which is a scalar and is interpreted using the specifiedUnitsIn.

The UnitsOut argument specifies in what units the returned number should be expressed. If you want the results expressed in the same units as the evaluated expression, pass "NOCAST" or **visNoCast**.

Examples where string is specified:




```
 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult("0.5 * 2", "ft", "ft") >>> 1.0 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult("0.5 * 2", "ft", "in") >>> 12.0 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult("1 cm", "ft", "in") >>> 0.39 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult("1 cm", "ft", "NOCAST") >>> 1.0 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult("1 cm", "ft", "") >>> 0.39 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult("1 cm", "ft", "bz") >>> exception: Bad measurement unit. 

```

Examples where number is specified:




```
 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult(1, "ft", "ft") >>> 1 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult(1, "ft", "in") >>> 12 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult(1.0, "in", "ft") >>> 8.33333333333333E-02 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult(1.0, visFeet, "") >>> 12 
Debug.Print vsoApplication.ConvertResult(1, "bz", "in") >>> exception: Bad measurement unit. 

```


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following macro shows how to use the  **ConvertResult** method to report the distance between two shapes in centimeters, feet, yards, and miles. To run this macro, you must have two shapes selected on your page.


```

 Else 
 Set vsoShape1 = vsoSelection.Item(1) 
 Set vsoShape2 = vsoSelection.Item(2) 
 
 'Pass the Visio Automation constant for inches (visInches, which is defined as 65) to the Result method to force units to inches 
 dblPinX1in = vsoShape1.Cells("PinX").Result(65) 
 dblPinY1in = vsoShape1.Cells("PinY").Result(65) 
 dblPinX2in = vsoShape2.Cells("PinX").Result(65) 
 dblPinY2in = vsoShape2.Cells("PinY").Result(65) 
 dblDistance = Sqr((dblPinX2in - dblPinX1in) ^ 2 + _ 
 (dblPinY2in - dblPinY1in) ^ 2) 
 
 'Convert distances from inches to centimeters, feet, yards, and miles 
 dblResult(1) = vsoApplication.ConvertResult(dblDistance, "in", "cm") 
 dblResult(2) = vsoApplication.ConvertResult(dblDistance, "in", "ft") 
 dblResult(3) = vsoApplication.ConvertResult(dblDistance, "in", "yd") 
 dblResult(4) = vsoApplication.ConvertResult(dblDistance, "in", "mi")

 Else 
 MsgBox "The drawing page must be active.", 0 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
