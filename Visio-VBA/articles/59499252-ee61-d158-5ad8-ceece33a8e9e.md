This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to set a shape's  **Data1**,  **Data2**, and  **Data3** properties. It prints the values of these properties in the **Immediate** window. You can also verify that these values have been set by opening the **Special** dialog box.


```
Public Sub Data123_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoPage As Visio.Page 
 Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
 
 Set vsoPage = Documents.Add("").Pages(1) 
 Set vsoShape = vsoPage.DrawRectangle(3, 3, 5, 5) 
 
 'Use the Data1, Data2, and Data3 properties to set 
 'the shape's Data fields. 
 vsoShape.Data1 = "Data1_String" 
 vsoShape.Data2 = "Data2_String" 
 vsoShape.Data3 = "Data3_String" 
 
 'Use the Data1, Data2, and Data3 properties to verify 
 'the shape's Data field values. 
 Debug.Print vsoShape.Data1 
 Debug.Print vsoShape.Data2 
 Debug.Print vsoShape.Data3
