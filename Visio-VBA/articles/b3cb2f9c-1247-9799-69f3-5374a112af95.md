# Shape.ClassID Property (Visio)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Visio 2013 Preview_

Returns the class ID string of a shape that represents an ActiveX control or an embedded or linked OLE object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ClassID**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

The  **ClassID** property raises an exception if the shape doesn't represent an ActiveX control or an OLE 2.0 embedded or linked object. A shape represents an ActiveX control or an OLE 2.0 embedded or linked object if the **visTypeIsOLE2** bit (&amp;H8000) is set in the value returned by **Shape**. **ForeignType**.

 **ClassID** returns a string of the form:




```
{2287DC42-B167-11CE-88E9-002AFDDD917}
```

This identifies the application that services the object. It might, for example, identify an embedded object on a Microsoft Visio page as a Microsoft Excel object.

After using a shape's  **Object** property to obtain an Automation interface on the object the shape represents, you might want to obtain the shape's **ClassID** or **ProgID** property to determine the methods and properties provided by the interface.
