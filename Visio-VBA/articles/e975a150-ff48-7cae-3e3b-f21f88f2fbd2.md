## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _expression_. **DropLinked**( **_ObjectToDrop_**,  **_x_**,  **_y_**,  **_DataRecordsetID_**,  **_DataRowID_**,  **_ApplyDataGraphicAfterLink_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Page** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ObjectToDrop|Required| **[UNKNOWN]**|The object to drop. While this is typically a Visio object such as a  **Master**,  **Shape**, or  **Selection** object; it can be any OLE object that provides an **IDataObject** interface.|
|x|Required| **Double**|The x-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's width or PinX.|
|y|Required| **Double**|The y-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's height or PinY.|
|DataRecordsetID|Required| **Long**|The ID of the data recordset that contains the data to link to.|
|DataRowID|Required| **Long**|The ID of the data row that contains the data to link to.|
|ApplyDataGraphicAfterLink|Required| **Boolean**|Whether to apply the current data graphic to the linked shape. The default is not to apply a data graphic. See Remarks for more information.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

When you want to create shapes already linked to data on a drawing page that either does not contain any shapes or contains shapes other than the ones you want to link, you can use the  **Page.DropLinked** and ** [Page.DropManyLinkedU](0b80591a-a563-bdad-b048-e15693410547.md)** methods to create one or more additional shapes already linked to data. These methods resemble the existing ** [Page.Drop](015615a8-fe64-5b76-39ba-ef7ed62e6846.md)** and ** [Page.DropManyU](e61d9e8f-3838-240e-b8da-c5f1d8b3eb12.md)** methods in that they create additional shapes at a specified location on the page; but in addition, they create links between the new shapes and specified data rows in a specified data recordset.

When the object you pass for the ObjectToDrop parameter is a shape, the center of the resulting shape's width-height box is positioned at the specified coordinates, and a  **Shape** object that represents the shape that is created is returned.

If ObjectToDrop is a  **Master**, the pin of the master is positioned at the specified coordinates. A master's pin is often, but not necessarily, at its center of rotation.

If you pass  **True** for the optional ApplyDataGraphicsAfterLink parameter, Visio applies the data graphic most recently applied to any other shape in the current document.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **DropLinked** method to create a shape on the active drawing page, centered at page coordinates (2, 2), and linked to a data row in the data recordset most recently added to the active document.

The shape passed to the  **DropLinked** method is a simple rectangle from the **Basic Shapes (US units)** stencil. Before running this macro, use the ** [DataRecordsets.Add](9eb136ce-d543-75c3-3a72-cb23dfc8df78.md)** method or another means to add at least one data recordset to the **DataRecordsets** collection, and make sure that the **Basic Shapes (US units)** stencil is open in the Visio drawing window. In this example, the ID of the data row is set to 1; before running the code, ensure that a row with that ID exists, or change the ID value in the code.




```
Public Sub DropLinked_Example() 
 
    Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
    Dim vsoMaster As Visio.Master 
    Dim dblX As Double 
    Dim dblY As Double  
    Dim lngDataRowID As Long 
    Dim vsoDataRecordset As Visio.DataRecordset 
    Dim intRecordesetCount As Integer 
 
    intRecordsetCount = Visio.ActiveDocument.DataRecordsets.Count 
    Set vsoDataRecordset = Visio.ActiveDocument.DataRecordsets(intRecordsetCount) 
     
    Set vsoMaster = Visio.Documents("Basic_U.VSS").Masters("Rectangle") 
    dblX = 2 
    dblY = 2 
    lngDataRowID = 1 
 
    Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DropLinked(vsoMaster, dblX, dblY, vsoDataRecordset.ID, lngDataRowID, True) 
 
End Sub
