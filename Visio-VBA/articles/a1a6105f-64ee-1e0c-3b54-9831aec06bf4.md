## Syntax

 _expression_. **ConnectionString**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **DataConnection** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

The value of the  **ConnectionString** property for a given **DataRecordset** object is the same string that you would pass to the ** [DataRecordsets.Add](9eb136ce-d543-75c3-3a72-cb23dfc8df78.md)** method to create the data recordset.

The easiest way to determine an appropriate connection string for a particular data source is to use the  **Data Selector Wizard** in the Visio user interface (UI) to make the same connection, recording a macro while running the wizard, and then copying the connection string from the macro code.

Setting the  **ConnectionString** property to a new value has no effect on data already in any data recordsets. To update the data in a data recordset using a new **ConnectionString** setting, call the ** [DataRecordset.Refresh](0a871f32-f24e-07c0-3cc6-a76f2a4ba2e2.md)** method.
