|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SelType|Required| **VisSelectionTypes**|The type of selection. See Remarks for possible values.|

|Data|Optional| **Variant**|The object type that corresponds to the SelType argument. See Remarks for possible values.|

## Remarks

The  **CreateSelection** method makes it possible to create complex selections programmatically. So instead of having to select all shapes on a page, for example, you can select only those on a given layer, or only those based on a certain master.

Calling the  **CreateSelection** method withSelType equal to **visSelTypeByType** or **visSelTypeByLayer** is equivalent to selecting options in the **Select byType** dialog box (click **Select** in the **Editing** group on the **Home** tab, and then click **Select by Type**).

The SelType argument should be one of the following values, which are declared in **VisSelectionTypes** in the Visio type library.



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSelTypeAll**|1|A selection that initially contains all shapes. |
| **visSelTypeByDataGraphic**|6|A selection that initially contains all shapes that have a given type of data graphic appled.|
| **visSelTypeByLayer**|3|A selection that initially contains all the shapes of a given layer. |
| **visSelTypeByMaster**|5|A selection that initially contains all the instantiated shapes of a given master. |
| **visSelTypeByRole**|7|A selection that initially contains all the shapes of a given role.|
| **visSelTypeByType**|4|A selection that initially contains all the shapes of a given type. |
| **visSelTypeEmpty**|0|A selection that initially contains no shapes. |
| **visSelTypeSingle**|2|A selection that initially contains one shape. |
The optional IterationMode argument should be one of the following values, which are declared in **VisSelectMode** in the Visio type library. The default is **visSelModeSkipSuper**.



|**Constant **|**Value **|**Description **|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSelModeOnlySub**|&amp;H0800|Selection only reports subselected shapes.|
| **visSelModeOnlySuper**|&amp;H0200|Selection only reports superselected shapes.|
| **visSelModeSkipSub**|&amp;H0400|Selection does not report subselected shapes.|
| **visSelModeSkipSuper**|&amp;H0100|Selection does not report superselected shapes.|
The optional Data argument should be an object that corresponds to the object type specified bySelType. For example, if you want to select all the masters of a certain type, Data should be of type **Master**. And if you want to select all the shapes on a certain layer, Data should be of type **Layer**.

When SelType is **visSelTypeByRole**,  _Data_ should be a member of the ** [VisRoleSelectionTypes](87e0e9fe-23c9-b554-a333-0ea7b3c7fb5b.md)** enumeration.

When the SelType argument is **visSelTypeByType**, possible Data values should be one of the following values, which are declared in **VisTypeSelectionTypes** in the Visio type library.



|**Constant **|**Value **|**Description **|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visTypeSelBitmap**|16|A shape that is a bitmap.|
| **visTypeSelGroup**|1|A shape that contains other shapes.|
| **visTypeSelGuide**|4|A shape that is a guide.|
| **visTypeSelInk**|32|A shape that is ink.|
| **visTypeSelMetafile**|8|A shape that is a metafile.|
| **visTypeSelOLE**|64|A shape that is linked, embedded, or a control.|
