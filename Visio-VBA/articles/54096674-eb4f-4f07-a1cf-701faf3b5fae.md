## Syntax

 _expression_. **SwapEnds**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.

## Remarks

The type of glue associated with the endpoints is also swapped. For example, if the begin point of a 1-D shape is glued to object A and the endpoint of the 1-D shape is not glued, after invoking the  **SwapEnds** method, the endpoint is glued to object A and the begin point is not glued.
