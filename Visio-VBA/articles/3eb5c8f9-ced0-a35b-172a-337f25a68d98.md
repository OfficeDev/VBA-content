## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ZoomToPoint**( **_X_**,  **_Y_**,  **_Percentage_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|X|Required| **Long**|The x-coordinate, in pixels in the coordinate system of the Visio Viewer window, of the point to place the upper left corner of the drawing.|
|Y|Required| **Long**|The y-coordinate, in pixels in the coordinate system of the Visio Viewer window, of the point to place the upper left corner of the drawing.|
|Percentage|Required| **Double**|The percentage of zoom.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Setting the Percentage parameter to 1 displays the drawing at its original size. Setting it to 2 doubles the length on both sides of the drawing by that factor, thus quadrupling the size of the drawing. Setting it to 0.5 displays the page at one-quarter its original size.

The origin of the coordinate system of the Visio Viewer window is its upper left corner. The positive x-direction is to the right, and the positive y-direction is down.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code displays the drawing at half its previous size, and places the upper left corner of the drawing at a point 200 pixels to the right and 200 pixels below the upper left corner of the Visio Viewer window.


```
vsoViewer.ZoomToPoint 200, 200, 0.5
```
