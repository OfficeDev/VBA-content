# How to contribute to an article

Thank you for contributing to the VBA community! You can:

* [Contribute using GitHub](#contribute-using-github) to make small changes to the article.
* [Contribute using Git](#contribute-using-git) to make large changes, or changes that involve code.
* Read the [FAQ](#faq).

The content in the VBA repository is grouped first by product, then by topic. The README.md file at the root of each topic directory specifies the structure of the articles within the topic. 

## Contribute using GitHub

Here you'll learn how to contribute to VBA documentation without having to clone the repo on your desktop. This is the quickest and easiest way to create a pull request in this repository. Use this method if you would like to make a minor change that doesn't involve code changes. 

1. Find the article you want to contribute to on GitHub. If the article is in MSDN, simply click the **suggest and submit changes** link in the **Contribute to this content** section and you'll be taken to the same article on GitHub.
2. Once you are on the article in GitHub, sign in to GitHub (you can get a free account [here](https://github.com/join)).
3. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit the file in your fork of this project) and make your changes in the **<>Edit file** window. 
4. Scroll to the bottom and enter a description.
5. Click **Propose file change**, and then click **Create pull request**.

You have just submitted a pull request to have this topic changed.
