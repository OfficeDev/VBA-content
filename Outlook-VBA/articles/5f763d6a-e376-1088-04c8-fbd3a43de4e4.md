# How to: Change the Accelerator and Caption of a Command Button

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

This example changes the  ** [Accelerator](896f426a-6bc7-c6cc-96a0-eb0106b027f1.md)** and ** [Caption](80dfbd73-6315-cb39-ad64-e87cf9083277.md)** properties of a ** [CommandButton](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md)** each time the user clicks the button by using the mouse or the accelerator key. The ** [Click](747d6f8f-c4da-f670-d476-21729387c4bc.md)** event contains the code to change the **Accelerator** and **Caption** properties.

To try this example, paste the code into the Script Editor of a form containing a  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1. To run the code you need to open the form so the **Open** event will activate.



```
Dim CommandButton1 
 
Sub Item_Open() 
 Set CommandButton1 = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("P.2").CommandButton1 
 CommandButton1.Accelerator = "C" 'Set Accelerator key to ALT + C 
End Sub 
 
Sub CommandButton1_Click () 
 If CommandButton1.Caption = "OK" Then 'Check caption, then change it. 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "Clicked" 
 CommandButton1.Accelerator = "C" 'Set Accelerator key to ALT + C 
 Else 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "OK" 
 CommandButton1.Accelerator = "O" 'Set Accelerator key to ALT + O 
 End If 
End Sub
```
