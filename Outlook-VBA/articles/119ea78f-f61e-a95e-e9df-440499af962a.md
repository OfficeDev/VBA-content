 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SetColumns**( **_Columns_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Results** object.


## Remarks

The  **SetColumns** method is useful for iterating through the ** [Results](59057f6f-8f6d-eed0-c945-240b9593b7ea.md)** object. If you don't use this method, Microsoft Outlook must open each item to access the property. With the **SetColumns** method, Outlook only checks the properties that you have cached. Properties which are not cached are returned empty.
