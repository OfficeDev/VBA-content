To change the value of an Outlook field, use the property name of the associated standard field. For example, to change the value of the Subject field, use the following code.




```
Item.Subject = "New Subject"
```

To change the value of a custom field, use the following code to refer to a custom field.



```
Item.UserProperties.Find("MyProperty").Value = "New Value"
```
