## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **AdvancedSearchComplete**( **_SearchObject_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SearchObject|Required| ** [Search](226a5d49-3caf-90dd-725c-265404d1939f.md)**|The  **Search**object returned by the  ** [AdvancedSearch](7b433d8b-08b9-dff1-b854-287d76b47a90.md)**method.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **AdvancedSearchComplete** event is used to return the object that was created by the **AdvancedSearch** method. This event only fires when the **AdvancedSearch** method is executed programmatically.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example searches the  **Inbox** for items where the subject is equal to "Test" and displays the names of the senders of the e-mail items returned by the search. The `AdvanceSearchComplete` event procedure sets the boolean `blnSearchComp` to **True** when the search is complete. This boolean variable is used by the `TestAdvancedSearchComplete()` procedure to determine when the search is complete. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as `ThisOutlookSession`. The  `TestAdvancedSearchComplete()` procedure must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```
Public blnSearchComp As Boolean 
 
 
 
Private Sub Application_AdvancedSearchComplete(ByVal SearchObject As Search) 
 
 MsgBox "The AdvancedSearchComplete Event fired." 
 
 blnSearchComp = True 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub TestAdvancedSearchComplete() 
 
 Dim sch As Outlook.Search 
 
 Dim rsts As Outlook.Results 
 
 Dim i As Integer 
 
 blnSearchComp = False 
 
 Const strF As String = "urn:schemas:mailheader:subject = 'Test'" 
 
 Const strS As String = "Inbox" 
 
 Set sch = Application.AdvancedSearch(strS, strF) 
 
 While blnSearchComp = False 
 
 DoEvents 
 
 Wend 
 
 Set rsts = sch.Results 
 
 For i = 1 To rsts.Count 
 
 MsgBox rsts.Item(i).SenderName 
 
 Next 
 
End Sub 
 

```
