# How to: Undo and Redo an Action in a Text Box or a Combo Box

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

The following example demonstrates how to undo or redo text editing within a  ** [TextBox](4a0e4a3d-beca-9f94-7e27-469c4bafe250.md)** or within the text area of a ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. This sample checks whether an undo or redo operation can occur and then performs the appropriate action. The sample uses the  **CanUndo** and **CanRedo** properties, and the **UndoAction** and **RedoAction** methods.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Script Editor of a form. To run the code you need to open the form so the  **Open** event will activate. Make sure that the form contains:

- A  **TextBox** named TextBox1.
    
- A  **ComboBox** named ComboBox1.
    
- Two  ** [CommandButton](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md)** controls named CommandButton1 and CommandButton2.
    



```
Dim UserForm1 
 
Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 If UserForm1.CanUndo = True Then 
 UserForm1.UndoAction 
 MsgBox "Undid IT" 
 Else 
 MsgBox "No undo performed." 
 End If 
End Sub 
 
Sub CommandButton2_Click() 
 If UserForm1.CanRedo = True Then 
 UserForm1.RedoAction 
 MsgBox "Redid IT" 
 Else 
 MsgBox "No redo performed." 
 End If 
End Sub 
 
Sub Item_Open() 
 Set UserForm1 = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("P.2") 
 Set TextBox1 = UserForm1.Controls("TextBox1") 
 Set ComboBox1 = UserForm1.Controls("ComboBox1") 
 Set CommandButton1 = UserForm1.Controls("CommandButton1") 
 Set CommandButton2 = UserForm1.Controls("CommandButton2") 
 
 TextBox1.Text = "Type your text here." 
 
 ComboBox1.ColumnCount = 3 
 ComboBox1.AddItem "Choice 1, column 1" 
 ComboBox1.List(0, 1) = "Choice 1, column 2" 
 ComboBox1.List(0, 2) = "Choice 1, column 3" 
 
 CommandButton1.Caption = "Undo" 
 CommandButton2.Caption = "Redo" 
End Sub
```
