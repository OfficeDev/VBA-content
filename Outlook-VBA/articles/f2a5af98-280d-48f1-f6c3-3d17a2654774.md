# SharingItem.Deny Method (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Denies a sharing request and sends a sharing response to the sender of the  ** [SharingItem](63dd3451-44f3-7cc4-c6e2-7dad5835a7d2.md)**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Deny**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **SharingItem** object.


### Return Value

A  **SharingItem** object that represents the sharing response.


## Remarks

The  **Deny** method can only be called on **SharingItem** objects with a ** [Type](1077b74f-38ee-8932-792d-64033bc66525.md)** property value of **olSharingMsgTypeRequest** or **olSharingMsgTypeInviteAndRequest**.

This method generates a new  **SharingItem** object and sets the **Type** property of the new object to **olSharingMsgTypeResponseDeny**. The  **SharingItem** is not immediately sent to the sender of the sharing request, however, so you can edit the sharing response as needed.


 **Note**  Sharing is denied immediately after this method is called, regardless of whether the sharing response was received.
