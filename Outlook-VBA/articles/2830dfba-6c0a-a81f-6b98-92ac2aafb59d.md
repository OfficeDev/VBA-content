# ExchangeDistributionList Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **ExchangeDistributionList** object provides detailed information about an ** [AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)** that represents an Exchange distribution list.

## Remarks

 **ExchangeDistributionList** is a derived class of **AddressEntry**, and is returned instead of an  **AddressEntry** when the caller performs a **QueryInterface** on the **AddressEntry**. 

The  **AddressEntry.Members** property supports enumerating members of a distribution list. **ExchangeDistributionList** adds the first-class properties for ** [Alias](9fef6b67-e08e-6aba-24ad-d9985329ba90.md)**,  ** [Comments](9456246f-30a7-5046-9b07-783649cd54f3.md)**, and  ** [PrimarySmtpAddress](f64bbc29-14c4-be68-402a-16d9ac34a727.md)**. You can also access other properties specific to the Exchange distribution list that are not exposed in the object model through the  ** [PropertyAccessor](2fc91e13-703c-3ec9-9066-ffee7144306c.md)** object.

Some properties such as  **Comments** are read-write properties. Setting these properties requires the code to be running under an appropriate Exchange administrator account; without sufficient permissions, calling the ** [ExchangeUser.Update](a2672fbf-f32a-f120-227c-24ee5c361f35.md)** method will result in a "permission denied" error.


## Example

The following code sample shows how to obtain the names of the Exchange distribution lists that the current user's manager belongs to. It uses the  ** [ExchangeUser.GetExchangeUserManager](ead5e950-7f7a-b213-0daf-c2bff890a30c.md)** method to obtain information about the user's manager, and uses ** [ExchangeUser.GetMemberOfList](1f4e8910-8998-85ab-05dc-d06f6fd323c3.md)** to obtain the distribution lists (represented by **ExchangeDistributionList** objects) that the manager has joined.


```
Sub ShowManagerDistLists() 
 Dim oAE As Outlook.AddressEntry 
 Dim oExUser As Outlook.ExchangeUser 
 Dim oDistListEntries As Outlook.AddressEntries 
 
 'Obtain the AddressEntry for CurrentUser 
 Set oExUser = _ 
 Application.Session.CurrentUser.AddressEntry.GetExchangeUser 
 
 'Obtain distribution lists that the user's manager has joined 
 Set oDistListEntries = oExUser.GetExchangeUserManager.GetMemberOfList 
 For Each oAE In oDistListEntries 
 If oAE.AddressEntryUserType = _ 
 olExchangeDistributionListAddressEntry Then 
 Debug.Print (oAE.name) 
 End If 
 Next 
End Sub 

```
