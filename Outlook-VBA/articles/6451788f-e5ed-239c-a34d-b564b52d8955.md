# RuleAction Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an action that is run when a  ** [Rule](ea2ddbcc-fd65-a636-c6da-79950033f385.md)** object executes.

## Remarks

 **RuleAction** is the base class for rule actions that are supported in programmatic rule creation. The classes derived from **RuleAction** include:


-  ** [AssignToCategoryRuleAction](402f4742-72ba-2559-4e4c-e2b8248cd7f6.md)**
    
-  ** [MarkAsTaskRuleAction](639d9242-7387-2b25-9d0f-f7a14cf16790.md)**
    
-  ** [MoveOrCopyRuleAction](db951ad8-0d05-1696-acf4-c1da4fbdee33.md)**
    
-  ** [NewItemAlertRuleAction](01d30816-50aa-ff23-69a0-4aa627b3d7e4.md)**
    
-  ** [PlaySoundRuleAction](6a7a1f78-640e-8ffc-558c-c26b87638d64.md)**
    
-  ** [SendRuleAction](4ea8f519-8bb3-b0bf-9742-8a492e7ffff7.md)**
    


The Rules object model provides partial parity with the Rules and Alerts Wizard in the Outlook user interface. It supports the most commonly used rule actions and conditions. Although it does not support creating rules with each rule action or rule condition that the Wizard supports, you can still enumerate and enable these rule actions and conditions in existing rules.
