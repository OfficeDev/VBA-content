 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Specifies if and how extensive entry matching is applied while the user types in a control.


|**Name**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **olMatchEntryComplete**|1|Extended matching. As each character is typed, the control searches for an entry matching all characters entered.|
| **olMatchEntryFirstLetter**|0|Basic matching: The control searches for the next entry that starts with the character entered. Repeatedly typing the same letter cycles through all entries beginning with that letter.|
| **olMatchEntryNone**|2|No matching is performed.|
