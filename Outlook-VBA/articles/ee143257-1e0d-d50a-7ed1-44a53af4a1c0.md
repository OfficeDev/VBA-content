# CheckBox.Caption Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **String** that appears on an object to identify or describe it. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Caption**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CheckBox** object.


## Remarks

The default caption for a control is a unique name based on the type of control. For example, CommandButton1 is the default caption for the first command button in a form.

If a control's caption is too long, the caption is truncated. If a form's caption is too long for the title bar, the title is displayed with an ellipsis.

The  ** [ForeColor](5c1f3216-a59f-8d22-5f6f-4c09572ffab9.md)** property of the control determines the color of the text in the caption.

Setting  ** [AutoSize](1bbe09ed-bf8e-3126-e756-ddd6035400d8.md)** to **True** automatically adjusts the size of the control to frame the entire caption.
