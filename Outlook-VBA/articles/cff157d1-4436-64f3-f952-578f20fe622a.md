# Distribution List Forms Overview

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You cannot customize the default pages of a distribution list form. Because the default pages provide much of the Microsoft Outlook distribution list functionality, do not hide them; instead, add additional functionality to a new page on the form.

You can customize the first page of a form by adding an adjoining form region or by using form regions to replace existing form pages. For more information, see  [Form Regions](66e80f83-60db-e3b1-47e9-097f855f6512.md).
