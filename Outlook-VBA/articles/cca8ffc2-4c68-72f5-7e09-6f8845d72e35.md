# OlkTextBox.SelStart Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Long** that specifies either the starting point of the selected text or the insertion point if no text has been selected. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelStart**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **OlkTextBox** object.


## Remarks

The current selection is specified by  ** [SelText](ba529e92-8a28-1c50-bf0a-0e67ae3645bc.md)**, which is a portion of the control's  ** [Value](6c0efe12-7b85-344e-a14c-3e628b0a3877.md)**. The maximum number of characters that can be supported for  **Value** is ** [MaxLength](7e7621e9-817a-ac05-a4de-e86656a021b1.md)**.

The default value is zero, which means no text is selected and the insertion point is at the beginning.

The  **SelStart** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus. Setting **SelStart** to a value less than zero causes an error. Setting **SelStart** to a value greater than **MaxLength** will reset **SelStart** to **MaxLength**. Changing the value of  **SelStart** cancels any existing selection, places the insertion point in the text, and sets the **SelLength** property to zero.
