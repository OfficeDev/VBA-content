# DocumentItem.BeforeAttachmentSave Event (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Occurs just before an attachment is saved.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **BeforeAttachmentSave**( **_Attachment_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DocumentItem** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Attachment|Required| ** [Attachment](3e11582b-ac90-0948-bc37-506570bb287b.md)**|The  **Attachment** to be saved.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**|(Not used in VBScript).  **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the save operation is not completed and the attachment is not changed.|

## Remarks

This event corresponds to when attachments are saved to the messaging store. The  **BeforeAttachmentSave** event occurs just before an attachment is saved when an item is saved. If a user edits an attachment and then saves those changes, the **BeforeAttachmentSave** event will not occur at that time; instead it will occur when the item itself is later saved. It also does not occur when the attachment is saved on the hard disk using the **SaveAsFile** method.

In VBScript, if you set the return value of this function to  **False**, the save operation is cancelled and the attachment is not changed.
