## Syntax

 _expression_. **GetCustomIcon**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object.

## Remarks

The returned  **IPictureDisp** object has its **Type** property equal to **PICTYPE_ICON** or **PICTYPE_BITMAP**.

 **GetCustomIcon** returns **Null** ( **Nothing** in Visual Basic) if the folder does not have a custom folder icon, or if the folder belongs to one of the following groups of folders:


- Default folders (as listed by the  ** [OlDefaultFolders](1a17abd8-09b9-d3e1-2d93-0a4d5580a950.md)** enumeration)
    
- Special folders (as listed by the  ** [OlSpecialFolders](31f32a19-9695-3de4-ef3f-fe763a6f878e.md)** enumeration)
    
- Exchange public folders
    
-  Root folder of any Exchange mailbox
    
- Hidden folders
    
You can only call  **GetCustomIcon** from code that runs in-process as Outlook. An **IPictureDisp** object cannot be marshaled across process boundaries. If you attempt to call **GetCustomIcon** from out-of-process code, an exception occurs.
