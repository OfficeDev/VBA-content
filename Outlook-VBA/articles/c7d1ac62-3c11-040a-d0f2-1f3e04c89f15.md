# How to: Control the Focus When the User Cycles through Controls in a Frame or MultiPage Control on a Form

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

The following example defines the  **Cycle** property for a ** [Frame](5fb494d3-8e00-852a-c361-0e99358b1ce8.md)** and two ** [Page](836941c3-c768-151a-65a5-41c71493033a.md)** objects in a ** [MultiPage](ac0fa233-81fe-8a34-4113-6907c6d8f7e2.md)**.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Script Editor of a form. To run the code you need to open the form so the  **Open** event will activate. Make sure that the form contains:

- A  **Frame** named Frame1.
    
- A  **MultiPage** named MultiPage1 that contains two objects named Page1 and Page2.
    
- Two  ** [CommandButton](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md)** controls named CommandButton1 and CommandButton2.
    
In the form, the  **Frame**, and each  **Page** of the **MultiPage**, place a couple of controls, so you can see how  **Cycle** affects the tab order of the **Frame** and **MultiPage**.
The user should tab through the controls to observe how  **Cycle** affects the tab order. Pressing CommandButton1 extends the tab order to include controls in the **Frame** and **Page** objects. Pressing CommandButton2 restricts the tab order.



```
Dim Frame1 
Dim MultiPage1 
 
Sub Item_Open() 
 Set Frame1 = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("P.2").Frame1 
 Set MultiPage1 = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("P.2").MultiPage1 
 RestrictCycles 
End Sub 
 
Sub RestrictCycles() 
 'Limit tab order for the Frame and Page objects 
 Frame1.Cycle = 2 
 MultiPage1.Page1.Cycle = 2 
 MultiPage1.Page2.Cycle = 2 
End Sub 
Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 'Extend tab order subforms (the Frame and Page objects) 
 Frame1.Cycle = 0 
 MultiPage1.Page1.Cycle = 0 
 MultiPage1.Page2.Cycle = 0 
End Sub 
 
Sub CommandButton2_Click() 
 RestrictCycles 
End Sub
```
