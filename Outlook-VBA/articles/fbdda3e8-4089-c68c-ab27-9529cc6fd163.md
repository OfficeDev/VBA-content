# Getting the Value of a Property

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Outlook provides several ways to get the value of a property:


|| _Object.Property_| ** [UserProperty.Value](9f313262-ffd4-3245-f516-bc2d62d6f33a.md)**| ** [ItemProperty.Value](81144bd5-15d5-a233-6001-f8c80392850f.md)**| ** [PropertyAccessor.GetProperty](a5f3493b-f302-c7b6-f442-23a7605be1c1.md)**| ** [PropertyAccessor.GetProperties](f1ba3c52-428a-9e9f-5b81-b68c5f27aa0f.md)**|
| **Action**|Gets the value of the specified explicit built-in property.|Gets the value of the specified custom item-level property. No action takes place if the property does not exist.|Gets the value of the specified built-in or custom item-level property, provided the property is not a blocked property. No action takes place if the property does not exist.|Gets an object that represents the value of the property specified by  _SchemaName_, provided the property is not a blocked property. Returns an error if the property does not exist.|For each property in  _SchemaNames_, provided the property is not a blocked property, gets the value of the property into a corresponding element in a variant array. Returns the variant array with property values when  **PropertyAccessor.GetProperties** obtains the value of all the properties in _SchemaNames_. Returns errors in the array otherwise.|
| **Applicable Objects**|All objects in the Outlook object model.|All  [Outlook item objects](6ea4babf-facf-4018-ef5a-4a484e55153a.md) including Microsoft Office document items ( ** [DocumentItem](7b0a6af0-6632-3ff6-841f-5b081d0d68d8.md)** objects)|All Outlook item objects including Microsoft Office document items ( **DocumentItem** objects)|Use  **ItemProperty** to get explicit built-in item-level properties. Use **PropertyAccessor.GetProperty** for item-level properties without explicit names, custom properties, or properties of any of the following objects: ** [AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)**,  ** [AddressList](84611afe-48b1-185b-df4b-0f004e7436ff.md)**,  ** [Attachment](3e11582b-ac90-0948-bc37-506570bb287b.md)**,  ** [ExchangeDistributionList](2830dfba-6c0a-a81f-6b98-92ac2aafb59d.md)**,  ** [ExchangeUser](6ec117d1-7fdb-aa36-b567-1242f8238df0.md)**,  ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)**,  ** [Recipient](8cee4d79-ec55-52a4-710b-6456944ca86d.md)**, and  ** [Store](1eb22fe9-8849-7476-5388-2515b48591b9.md)**.|Same objects as stated in the  **GetProperty** column.|
| **Property Type Support**|As specified in the Outlook object model.|Returns a  **Variant** object.|Returns a  **Variant** object.| The type of the object returned will be the same as the type of the property specified by _SchemaName_. If you require conversion of the raw property type to a string (for  **PT_BINARY** in MAPI) or a local time ( **PT_SYSTIME**), use the  ** [PropertyAccessor](2fc91e13-703c-3ec9-9066-ffee7144306c.md)** helper methods ** [PropertyAccessor.UTCToLocalTime](a56311ac-60ac-4f51-5255-d6840bf6004d.md)** or ** [PropertyAccessor.BinaryToString](4a3801af-0a7c-4b8a-7367-600c09047b28.md)**. The  **PropertyAccessor** does not support certain MAPI property types, for example, **PT_OBJECT**, and attempting to get the value of properties of such types will return "Property operation not supported" error.|Property type support is the same as in the  **GetProperty** column because the type of each value should be the same as the type of the corresponding property in _SchemaNames_. Any error including type mismatch is returned in the resultant array.|
| **Security**|On a client computer running Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 or later, without an appropriately set up antivirus software, untrusted code attempting to access protected properties will, by default, get the address book security warning. |Trusted and untrusted code can use the  ** [UserProperty](c94f642f-4368-d775-a79f-ce6c39bfe1fd.md)** object. On a client computer running Office Outlook 2007 or later without an appropriately set up antivirus software, untrusted code attempting to use the **UserProperty** object to access a protected property will, by default, get the address book security warning.|Trusted and untrusted code can use the  ** [ItemProperty](3570d1f9-40ed-0a99-f63c-141134418c3b.md)** object. On a client computer running Office Outlook 2007 or later without an appropriately set up antivirus software, untrusted code attempting to use the **ItemProperty** object to access a protected property will, by default, get the address book security warning.|On a client computer without an appropriately set up antivirus software, untrusted code attempting to access the  **PropertyAccessor** property of an item object will by default invoke the address book security warning.|Same security considerations as in the  **GetProperty** column.|
| **Performance**|No performance overhead. Use this whenever the property is an explicit built-in property.|No performance overhead. Use this object whenever the property is a custom property at the item-level.|No performance overhead. Use this object whenever the property is a custom item-level property.|Using the  **PropertyAccessor** to access properties incurs performance overhead. For getting multiple properties, use **PropertyAccessor.GetProperties** as opposed to repeated **PropertyAccessor.GetProperty**.|Using the  **PropertyAccessor** to access properties incurs performance overhead.
