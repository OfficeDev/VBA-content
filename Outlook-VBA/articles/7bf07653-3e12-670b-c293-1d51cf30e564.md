 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs when an explorer stops being the active window, either as a result of user action or through program code.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Deactivate**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Explorer** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  ** [WindowState](787b6339-eb92-3ab6-df9f-82f6122facc5.md)**property to minimize the topmost explorer window when it is not active. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_Deactivate() 
 
 myOlExp.WindowState = olMinimized 
 
End Sub
```
