# OlkTimeControl.IntervalTime Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Date** that specifies the number of minutes displayed as an interval used for the **olTimeStyleTimeDuration** style setting on the time control. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **IntervalTime**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **OlkTimeControl** object.


## Remarks

The default value is 30.

The minimum value for  **IntervalTime** is 1 and the maximum value is 1440. Assigning a value outside of this range will result in the nearest edge value being used instead.

When  ** [Style](4a5f2651-e4ed-50f0-a842-6c6d965e928a.md)** is **olTimeStyleTimeDuration**, the date control displays the value of  ** [ReferenceTime](3979de6d-4992-f42c-b894-7f9661826ca6.md)** as the first selectable time value, shows additional intervals (specified by **IntervalTime**) starting from the  **ReferenceTime** value, and shows the duration of an event.

The default value for  **ReferenceTime** is 30 Dec 1899 12:00 AM. In this case, the time control will display **30 Dec 1899 12:00 AM** as the first selectable time. A value of 60 for **IntervalTime** will mark **30 Dec 1899 1:00 AM** as the first interval.
