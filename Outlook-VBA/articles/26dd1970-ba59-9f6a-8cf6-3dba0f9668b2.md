 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Search** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This property is determined by the  _SearchSubfolders_ argument of the ** [AdvancedSearch](7b433d8b-08b9-dff1-b854-287d76b47a90.md)**method and is specified when the search is initiated. If  **True**, the  **Search** object searches through any subfolders in the specified filter path.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example creates a  **Search** object. The user's **Inbox** is specified as the scope of the search and the **SearchSubFolders** property is set to **True**. The event subroutine fires when the search has completed and displays the  **Tag** and **Scope** properties for the new object as well as the results of the search.

Private Sub Application_AdvancedSearchComplete(ByVal SearchObject As Search) 
 
 MsgBox "The AdvancedSearchComplete Event fired for " &amp; SearchObject.Tag &amp; _

 blnSearchComp = True 
 
End Sub
