# Enumerate Search Folders on All Stores

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

This topic describes a code sample that enumerates the search folders on all stores for the current session.


1. The code sample begins by getting all the stores for the current session using the  ** [NameSpace.Stores](4ffdc2b3-be7b-da21-ac85-bde5481ae2f2.md)** property of the current session, `Application.Session`.
    
2. For each store of this session, it uses  ** [Store.GetSearchFolders](aed6ba0b-5e20-adb9-6f62-d030a0de2e0b.md)** to obtain the collection of search folders for that store.
    
3. For each collection of search folders, it displays the name of each folder.
    

## Remarks

To run this code sample, place the code in the built-in  **ThisOutlookSession** module. Run the `EnumerateSearchFoldersInStores` procedure:


```
Sub EnumerateSearchFoldersInStores() 
 Dim colStores As Outlook.Stores 
 Dim oStore As Outlook.Store 
 Dim oSearchFolders As Outlook.folders 
 Dim oFolder As Outlook.Folder 
 
 On Error Resume Next 
 Set colStores = Application.Session.Stores 
 For Each oStore In colStores 
 Set oSearchFolders = oStore.GetSearchFolders 
 For Each oFolder In oSearchFolders 
 Debug.Print (oFolder.FolderPath) 
 Next 
 Next 
End Sub
```
