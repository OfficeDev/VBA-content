 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

This topic describes how to obtain the names of the Exchange distribution lists that the manager of the current user belongs to. It uses the  ** [ExchangeUser](6ec117d1-7fdb-aa36-b567-1242f8238df0.md)** object to obtain specific Exchange user information such as the user's Exchange account alias, details about the user's manager, and the distribution lists that the user's manager has joined:


1. Obtain the current user's ExchangeUser object. Use the  ** [GetExchangeUser](eaaafd52-42c9-7f6b-1acb-0b987496d604.md)** method of the ** [AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)** object for the current user to get the **ExchangeUser** object that represents the current user.
    
2. Obtain the distribution lists that the user's manager has joined.Use the  **ExchangeUser** methods ** [GetExchangeUserManager](ead5e950-7f7a-b213-0daf-c2bff890a30c.md)** and ** [GetMemberOfList](1f4e8910-8998-85ab-05dc-d06f6fd323c3.md)** to find these distribtution lists. Use the ** [ExchangeDistributionList](2830dfba-6c0a-a81f-6b98-92ac2aafb59d.md)** object to obtain further information about a distribution list, such as its display name.

 Application.Session.CurrentUser.AddressEntry.GetExchangeUser 
 
 'Obtain distribution lists that the user's manager has joined 
 Set oDistListEntries = oExUser.GetExchangeUserManager.GetMemberOfList 
 For Each oAE In oDistListEntries 
 If oAE.AddressEntryUserType = _ 
 olExchangeDistributionListAddressEntry Then 
 Debug.Print (oAE.name)
