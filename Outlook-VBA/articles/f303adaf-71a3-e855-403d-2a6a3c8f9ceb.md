## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  **ReplyAll**event and reminds the user that proceeding will reply to all original recipients of an item and, depending on the user's response, either allows the action to continue or stops it. To use this example, open an existing mail item, run the  `Initialize Handler()` procedure, then reply to the item.


```
Public WithEvents myItem As MailItem 
 
 
 
Sub Initialize_Handler() 
 
 Set myItem = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myItem_ReplyAll(ByVal Response As Object, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Dim mymsg As String 
 
 Dim myResult As Integer 
 
 mymsg = "Do you really want to reply to all original recipients?" 
 
 myResult = MsgBox(mymsg, vbYesNo, "Flame Protector") 
 
 If myResult = vbNo Then 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
