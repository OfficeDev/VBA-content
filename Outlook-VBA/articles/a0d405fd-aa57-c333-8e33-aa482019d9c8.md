The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example displays the name of the view that has been removed from the collection when the  **ViewRemove** event is fired. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `DeleteView()` procedure should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents objViews As Outlook.Views 
 
Sub DeleteView() 
 Set objViews = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Views 
 objViews.Item("New Table View").Delete 
End Sub 
 
Sub objViews_ViewRemove(ByVal View As View) 
 'Displays view name 
 MsgBox "The view: " &amp; View.Name &amp; " was removed programmatically." 
End Sub
```
