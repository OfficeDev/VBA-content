# ComboBox.TextColumn Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Variant** that identifies the column in a ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)** to display to the user. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **TextColumn**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

Values for the  **TextColumn** property range from -1 to the number of columns in the list. The **TextColumn** value for the first column is 1, the value of the second column is 2, and so on. Setting **TextColumn** to 0 displays the ** [ListIndex](2c4e473b-15e1-dce2-8748-30953b00a60f.md)** values. Setting **TextColumn** to -1 displays the first column that has a ** [ColumnWidths](434b2e52-fe2c-78ff-2fc6-1c0b9b858ebc.md)** value greater than 0.

When the user selects a row from a  **ComboBox**, the column referenced by  **TextColumn** is stored in the ** [Text](3db98bbc-fa35-ed1f-d937-9ffeed45aed3.md)** property. For example, you could set up a multicolumn **ComboBox** that contains the names of holidays in one column and dates for the holidays in a second column. To present the holiday names to users, specify the first column as the **TextColumn**. To store the dates of the holidays, specify the second column as the  ** [BoundColumn](0ebc2ce0-f3f6-ce96-749c-be49343bc978.md)**.

When the  **Text** property of a **ComboBox** changes (such as when a user types an entry into the control), the new text is compared to the column of data specified by **TextColumn**.
