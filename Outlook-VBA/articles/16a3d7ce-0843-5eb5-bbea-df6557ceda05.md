# ContactItem.Unload Event (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Occurs before an Outlook item is unloaded from memory, either programmatically or by user action. 

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Unload**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ContactItem** object.


## Remarks

This event occurs after the  **Close** event for the Outlook item occurs, but before the Outlook item is unloaded from memory, allowing an add-in to release any resources related to the object. Although the event occurs before the Outlook item is unloaded from memory, this event cannot be canceled.


 **Note**  This event is meant only as a notification event, so that an add-in can dereference the object. An error occurs if any property or method for this object is called within the  **Unload** event.
