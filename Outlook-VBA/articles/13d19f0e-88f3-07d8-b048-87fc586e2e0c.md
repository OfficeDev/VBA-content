You can select stores to search in the  **Locations to Search** menu by clicking **Search Tools** in the **Options** group of the **Search** contextual tab in the Microsoft Office Fluent ribbon.

By default, search does not include the Deleted Items folder. To search the Deleted Items folder, set that folder as your current folder and search by  **olSearchScopeCurrentFolder**.
