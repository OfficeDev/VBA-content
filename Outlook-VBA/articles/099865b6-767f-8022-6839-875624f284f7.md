# SyncObject Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a  **Send\Receive** group for a user.

## Remarks

A  **Send\Receive** group lets users configure different synchronization scenarios, selecting which folders and which filters apply.

Use the  ** [Item](44a2ffaf-6bb7-28dc-9d15-c9b87c1c62dd.md)** method to retrieve the **SyncObject** object from a ** [SyncObjects](88e59f63-d834-b174-bbda-0af0cf2d0520.md)** object. Because the ** [Name](11c17377-1e4f-866a-76b7-3878b7e5151a.md)** property is the default property of the **SyncObject** object, you can identify the group by name.

The  **SyncObject** object is read-only; you cannot change its properties or create new ones. However, note that you can add one **Send/Receive** group using the ** [SyncObjects.AppFolders](711ebc16-12ac-9df3-31af-a883f438814f.md)** property which will create a **Send/Receive** group called **Application Folders**.


## Example

The following example retrieves a  **SyncObject** object by name.


```
Set mySyncObject = mySyncObjects.Item("Daily")
```
