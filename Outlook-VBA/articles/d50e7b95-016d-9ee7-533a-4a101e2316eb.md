# How to: Move Controls on a Page

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

The following example demonstrates moving all the controls on a form by using the  **Move** method with the Microsoft Forms 2.0 **Controls** collection. The user clicks on the ** [CommandButton](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md)** to move the controls.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Script Editor of a form. Make sure that the form contains a  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1 and several other controls.



```
Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 Set Controls = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("P.2").Controls 
 'Move each control on the form right 25 points and up 25 points. 
 Controls.Move 25, -25 
End Sub
```
