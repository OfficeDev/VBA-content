 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an Outlook item that is in conflict with another Outlook item.

## Remarks

 Each Outlook item has a ** [Conflicts](c4e1c060-519a-a6d1-8fb2-c7dfa1e3e66f.md)** collection object associated with it that represents all the items that are in conflict with that item.

Use the  ** [Item](efd74c23-31fb-1a3c-aebc-27ce22f1c3bf.md)** method to retrieve a particular **Conflict** object from the **Conflicts** collection object, for example:


## Example
