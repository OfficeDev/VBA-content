# Page.Name Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **String** that specifies the name of an object. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Name**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Page** object.


## Remarks

Guidelines for assigning a string to  **Name**, such as the maximum length of the name, vary from one application to another.

For objects, the default value of  **Name** consists of the object's class name followed by an integer. For example, the default name for the first ** [TextBox](4a0e4a3d-beca-9f94-7e27-469c4bafe250.md)** you place on a form is TextBox1. The default name for the second **TextBox** is TextBox2.

You can set the  **Name** property for a control from the control's property sheet or, for controls added at run time, by using program statements. If you add a control at design time, you cannot modify its **Name** property at run time.
