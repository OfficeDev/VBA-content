# AddressEntries.GetFirst Method (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the first object in the  ** [AddressEntries](db91b717-07c6-d1f2-c545-b766ee1f0c6b.md)** collection.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **GetFirst**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **AddressEntries** object.


### Return Value

An  ** [AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)** object that represents the first object contained by the collection.


## Remarks

Returns  **Nothing** if no first object exists, for example, if there are no objects in the collection. To ensure correct operation of the **GetFirst**,  ** [GetLast](22b54c0f-5167-ac76-0cff-7ee4a142e1b3.md)**,  ** [GetNext](7579909c-90a2-660f-6cf5-039a441ccc93.md)**, and  ** [GetPrevious](3d5aa211-212e-9a97-58aa-47d4447c9f47.md)** methods in a large collection, call **GetFirst** before calling **GetNext** on that collection and call **GetLast** before calling **GetPrevious**. To ensure that you are always making the calls on the same collection, create an explicit variable that refers to that collection before entering the loop.
