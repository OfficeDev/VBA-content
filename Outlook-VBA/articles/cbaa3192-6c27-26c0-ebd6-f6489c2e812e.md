# Outlook Views

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Microsoft Outlook allows you to create customizable views that allow you to better sort, group, and ultimately view data of all different types within an explorer. There are a variety of different view types that provide the flexibility needed to create and maintain your important data. Outlook supports the following objects, derived from the  ** [View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)** object.


|Object name|Description|
| ** [BusinessCardView](83706cf8-080c-fbf0-9381-5801a2dd4dfd.md)**|This object allows you to view data as a series of Electronic Business Card (EBC) images.|
| ** [CalendarView](37e078b9-9fc6-5894-b043-06d7257666a8.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a calendar format.|
| ** [CardView](cdac229b-f2b6-9ecb-e1a7-b53509426570.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a series of cards.|
| ** [IconView](dc2efa6c-4752-f713-f77e-378036f358dc.md)**|This object allows you to view data as icons, similar to a Windows folder or explorer.|
| ** [TableView](026e27f8-1655-060d-e8cc-87eaaf4f1510.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a simple, field-based table.|
| ** [TimelineView](fb14c1a1-f542-fa1e-f30f-c5ee3d2f0206.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a customizable linear time line.|
While you can use the  **View** object to interact with the properties and methods common to all views, you must cast the **View** object to one of the derived view objects, such as the **CardView** object, to access certain properties, such as the ** [HeadingsFont](3287437e-4ac5-35f5-818a-caea608f8095.md)** property of the **CardView** object. You can use the ** [ViewType](db44b9ec-cb55-c9f4-d621-32d2f46598dd.md)** property of the **View** object to determine which type of view is represented by that object.
You can define a new view by using the  ** [Add](8005ca2e-8b28-1286-74d1-448f2a168c65.md)** method of the ** [Views](5dd7edc2-12a2-f4c2-d158-8053d80e8dc9.md)** collection for a ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object. Visibility for the view can be set either at the time of creation, by specifying an ** [OlViewSaveOption](c08bab4d-ecdd-a2ac-1cdc-fa910f9585e0.md)** constant in the _SaveOption_ parameter of the **Add** method, or any time after the view is created, by specifying an **OlViewSaveOption** constant for the ** [SaveOption](d7990708-5eb4-1b11-944e-127793bdb5b1.md)** property of the **View** object. Adding a new view raises the ** [ViewAdd](926eb4eb-7585-5bb0-b214-6e116a01375e.md)** event of the **Views** collection.
You can use the  ** [Remove](73a92be6-8dc4-6fb9-7f20-0ff678445737.md)** method of the **Views** object to remove an existing custom view. Removing a view raises the ** [ViewRemove](a0d405fd-aa57-c333-8e33-aa482019d9c8.md)** event of the **Views** collection.
Once a view is defined, you can customize the view programmatically by casting the  **View** object to one of the derived view objects, such as the **BusinessCardView** object, and performing whatever changes are needed. Use the ** [Save](effc4046-2e9c-3898-e37f-c4de817ddde7.md)** method of the derived view object or the **View** object to save any changes to the view.
You can apply the view, once defined and customized, to the current  ** [Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)** object by using the ** [Apply](b121d1ce-24b7-4ace-8369-42e5c7becd0a.md)** method of the derived view object or the **View** object. Applying a view raises the ** [ViewSwitch](ab981f42-d429-ccd7-a25c-142e52683020.md)** event of the **Explorer** object.
