# Font.Bold Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that specifies whether text is normal or bold. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Bold**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Font** object.


## Remarks

 **True** to indicate that the text with this font is bold, **False** otherwise.

The font's appearance on screen and in print may differ, depending on your computer and printer. If you select a font that your system can't display with the specified attribute or that isn't installed, Windows substitutes a similar font. The substitute font will be as similar as possible to the font originally requested.

Changing the value of  **Bold** also changes the value of ** [Weight](674d5bd0-3cf7-1330-5d3c-7b742bb3df7c.md)**. Setting  **Bold** to **True** sets **Weight** to 700; setting **Bold** to **False** sets **Weight** to 400. Conversely, setting **Weight** to anything over 550 sets **Bold** to **True**; setting  **Weight** to 550 or less sets **Bold** to **False**.
