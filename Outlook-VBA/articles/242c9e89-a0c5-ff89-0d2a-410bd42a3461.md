# Properties Overview

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015



## Outlook Properties

A property is an attribute of a Microsoft Outlook object. Properties describe something about the object, such as the sender of a message item, or the number of items in a folder. Outlook defines many properties; these are referred to as built-in properties in this documentation. The Outlook object model exposes many built-in properties with string names, such as the  **Subject** property of a mail item. These properties are further qualified as explicit built-in properties. Customers and service providers can extend the predefined properties of Outlook by creating new, custom properties. For example, through custom forms, customers can define properties to extend the functionality for a specific message class, and service providers can define properties to expose the unique features of their messaging system.


## Object Model Entry Points

The Outlook object model provides several approaches to access Outlook properties, such as:


- Referencing a property directly from the parent object to access explicit built-in properties of item objects (for example, the  ** [MailItem.SenderEmailAddress](a157894c-adf2-1cef-ec7c-8516dbef2b7f.md)** property)
    
- Using  ** [ItemProperties](34a110ed-6617-72da-1e98-a9773c705b40.md)** and ** [ItemProperty](3570d1f9-40ed-0a99-f63c-141134418c3b.md)** to enumerate explicit built-in properties and custom properties and access custom properties of item objects
    
- Using  ** [UserProperties](20b49c86-d74f-9bda-382c-559af278c148.md)** and ** [UserProperty](c94f642f-4368-d775-a79f-ce6c39bfe1fd.md)** to enumerate and access custom properties of item objects
    
- Using the  ** [PropertyAccessor](2fc91e13-703c-3ec9-9066-ffee7144306c.md)** object to access built-in and custom properties of the following objects:
    
      -  ** [AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)**
    
  -  ** [AddressList](84611afe-48b1-185b-df4b-0f004e7436ff.md)**
    
  -  ** [Attachment](3e11582b-ac90-0948-bc37-506570bb287b.md)**
    
  -  ** [ExchangeDistributionList](2830dfba-6c0a-a81f-6b98-92ac2aafb59d.md)**
    
  -  ** [ExchangeUser](6ec117d1-7fdb-aa36-b567-1242f8238df0.md)**
    
  -  ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)**
    
  -  [Outlook item objects](6ea4babf-facf-4018-ef5a-4a484e55153a.md)
    
  -  ** [Recipient](8cee4d79-ec55-52a4-710b-6456944ca86d.md)**
    
  -  ** [Store](1eb22fe9-8849-7476-5388-2515b48591b9.md)**
    

 **Note**  Although  **ItemProperties** and **UserProperties** support enumerating explicit built-in properties, and ** [UserProperties.Find](3b71ce5a-4bb0-fdab-a24e-02c631816b80.md)** supports searching for explicit built-in properties, use these objects primarily for custom properties of item objects. Use the **PropertyAccessor** object to access properties of non-item objects, or item-level properties that are not explicitly exposed in the Outlook object model.

The following table shows when to use which entry points:



|| **Object.Property**| **UserProperty, UserProperties**| **ItemProperty, ItemProperties**| **PropertyAccessor**|
| **Action on Properties**|Get and set explicit built-in properties of item objects. |Enumerate, create, get, set, and remove custom properties of item objects. |Enumerate explicit built-in properties and custom properties of item objects; create, get, set, and remove custom properties of item objects. |Get and set built-in properties, and create, get, set, and remove custom properties. Objects include item objects and the following:  **AddressEntry**,  **AddressList**,  **Attachment**,  **ExchangeUser**,  **ExchangeDistributionList**,  **Folder**,  **Recipient**, and  **Store**. Access properties by the appropriate namespaces. For more information, see  [Referencing Properties by Namespace](c1c7bfa9-64d7-81d2-84e7-f0a4c57780b3.md).|
| **Performance**|No performance overhead.|Enumerating and accessing properties using  **UserProperties** can incur performance overhead.|Enumerating and accessing properties using  **ItemProperties** can incur performance overhead.|Using the  **PropertyAccessor** to access properties incurs performance overhead. For getting or setting multiple properties, use **GetProperties** and **SetProperties** as opposed to repeated calls to **GetProperty** and **SetProperty**.|
