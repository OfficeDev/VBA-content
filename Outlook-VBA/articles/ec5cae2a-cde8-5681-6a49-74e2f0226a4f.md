# ToOrFromRuleCondition Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a rule condition that the sender or the recipeints of the message, as specified by  ** [ToOrFromRuleCondition.ConditionType](a5c6e08c-643e-965d-cd3e-b434f20579a0.md)**, is in the recipients list specified in  ** [ToOrFromRuleCondition.Recipients](4d1a3cb4-ec6e-b8d0-a4d2-0ebe1f829b00.md)**.

## Remarks

 **ToOrFromRuleCondition** is derived from the ** [RuleCondition](e03f91c2-2c08-b036-104a-d6246f28bc2d.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a ** [RuleConditions](e8e9a05a-b36b-add2-b294-8cdc5a97e119.md)** object which has a ** [SentTo](54039c2f-b2a5-2878-84c0-b129b4ce96fa.md)** property and a ** [From](3ebda0d0-ba44-95c6-ed02-a9c6acbf1f1c.md)**. Each of these properties always returns a  **ToOrFromRuleCondition** object. **ToOrFromRuleCondition.ConditionType** distinguishes between these rule conditions. If the rule has any of these rule conditions enabled, then ** [ToOrFromRuleCondition.Enabled](31e43906-b47a-95e3-d51b-3fa6af553fad.md)** would be **True**.
