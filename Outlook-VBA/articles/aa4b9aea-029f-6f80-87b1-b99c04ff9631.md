The event subroutine occurs when the search has completed and displays the **[Tag](f0341885-ea75-2277-e55b-827f62165ab2.md)** and **Scope** properties for the new object in addition to the results of the search.


```vb
Public blnSearchComp As Boolean 
 
 
 
Private Sub Application_AdvancedSearchComplete(ByVal SearchObject As Search) 
 
 MsgBox "The AdvancedSearchComplete Event fired for " &; SearchObject.Tag &; " and the scope was " &; SearchObject.Scope 
 
 blnSearchComp = True 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub TestAdvancedSearchComplete() 
 
 'List all items in the Inbox that do NOT have a flag. 
 
 Dim objSch As Outlook.Search 
 
 Const strF As String = "urn:schemas:httpmail:messageflag IS NULL" 
 
 Const strS As String = "Inbox" 
 
 Dim rsts As Outlook.Results 
 
 Dim i As Integer 
 
 blnSearchComp = False 
 
 Const strF1 As String = "urn:schemas:mailheader:subject = 'Test'" 
 
 Const strS1 As String = "Inbox" 
 
 Set objSch = _ 
 
 Application.AdvancedSearch(Scope:=strS1, Filter:=strF1, Tag:="FlagSearch") 
 
 While blnSearchComp = False 
 
 DoEvents 
 
 Wend 
 
 Set rsts = objSch.Results 
 
 For i = 1 To rsts.Count 
 
 MsgBox rsts.Item(i).SenderName 
 
 Next 
 
End Sub
```
