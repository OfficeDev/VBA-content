 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that determines if the ** [RuleAction](6451788f-e5ed-239c-a34d-b564b52d8955.md)** is enabled. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **RuleAction** object.


## Remarks

After you enable a rule action, you must also save the rule by using  ** [Rules.Save](d838eca0-4ec5-ab43-a031-fd65ab7d9f3c.md)** so that the rule action and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule action is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.
