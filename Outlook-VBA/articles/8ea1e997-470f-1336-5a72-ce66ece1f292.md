 _expression_. **ListCount**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

 **ListCount** is the number of rows over which you can scroll. **ListCount** is always one greater than the largest value for the ** [ListIndex](2c4e473b-15e1-dce2-8748-30953b00a60f.md)** property, because index numbers begin with 0 and the count of items begins with 1. If no item is selected, **ListCount** is 0 and **ListIndex** is -1.
