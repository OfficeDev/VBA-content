# Attachment.Position Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Long** indicating the position of the attachment within the body of the item. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Position**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Attachment** object.


## Remarks

The  **Position** property only works on an attachment for an item where the body format is Rich Text (RTF). If the body format is not RTF, the **Position** property is ignored for a set operation and always returns zero (0) for a get operation.

If you set the  **Position** property to 0 for an item where the body format is RTF, the attachment will be hidden in Outlook's user interface. The attachment is not visible in a view, and the user cannot remove the attachment from the body of the item. The attachment can still be accessed through the ** [Attachments](4cc96a5f-a822-8ad5-6f61-e996bee8ba22.md)** collection on the item.

The only item that allows programmatic setting of the  **BodyFormat** property is a ** [MailItem](14197346-05d2-0250-fa4c-4a6b07daf25f.md)**. Other item types such as Appointment, Contact, and Task are RTF by default.
