# RuleConditions.OnLocalMachine Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  ** [RuleCondition](e03f91c2-2c08-b036-104a-d6246f28bc2d.md)** object with a ** [RuleCondition.ConditionType](d695339d-5b64-dffb-652e-ac993fca4489.md)** of **olConditionLocalMachineOnly**. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **OnLocalMachine**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **RuleConditions** object.


## Remarks

Use the returned  **RuleCondition** object when enumerating the rule conditions or exception conditions of an existing rule, or when creating a new rule that specifies the condition or exception condition that the rule can run on this machine only. When you run the same rule on another computer, the rule will show that the condition **olConditionOtherMachine** is enabled.

This property of the  ** [RuleConditions](e8e9a05a-b36b-add2-b294-8cdc5a97e119.md)** collection always returns a **RuleCondition** object regardless of whether the rule associated with this **RuleConditions** collection has defined such a rule condition. You can programmatically enable a rule condition of this type. In certain cases, **olConditionLocalMachine** is automatically set as a result of enabling another rule condition such as **olConditionAccount**. If the rule has defined and enabled such a rule condition, then  ** [RuleCondition.Enabled](43a6aa5f-18da-1b6c-a481-f30718725bd8.md)** will be **True**.
