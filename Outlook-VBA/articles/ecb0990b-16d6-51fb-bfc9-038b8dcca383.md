 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns an  ** [Account](f624438c-4e45-2822-18b6-bfe8074a33c0.md)** object that represents the selected account in the Microsoft Office Backstage view in Microsoft Outlook. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelectedAccount**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  ** [AccountSelector](846f176e-5680-a214-7624-75f3a524c989.md)** object.


## Remarks

In the Outlook user interface, you can select an account explicitly on the  **Info** tab of the Backstage view, or you can select an account implicitly when you select a folder in a list of folders. The **SelectedAccount** property represents the currently selected account in the Backstage view for a given instance of the ** [Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)** object. To determine the account that is selected implicitly, identify the **Account** object that has its ** [DefaultStore](4080e227-bd76-3168-7bc7-93fe04023a3b.md)** property equal to the ** [Store](347d3031-01cf-a248-4abc-f749feb811a4.md)** property of the current folder (which is represented by ** [Explorer.CurrentFolder](75e7f120-28df-0c3b-ec05-bd880621141b.md)**). 

This property returns  **Null** ( **Nothing** in Visual Basic) if no accounts are defined in the session's profile; that is, the ** [Namespace.Accounts.Count](bb29c680-339d-0d92-2500-2116ce7054c2.md)** property is 0.
