# MeetingItem Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a change to the recipient's Calendar folder initiated by another party or as a result of a group action.

## Remarks

Unlike other Microsoft Outlook objects, you cannot create this object. It is created automatically when you set the  ** [MeetingStatus](cfd970cd-df6c-4537-0a17-b5adab3b667f.md)**property of an  ** [AppointmentItem](204a409d-654e-27aa-643a-8344c631b82d.md)**object to  **olMeeting** and send it to one or more users. They receive it in their inboxes as a **MeetingItem**.

Use the  ** [GetAssociatedAppointment](8344d40d-5c1d-ead3-87cb-fd795b831712.md)**method to return the  **AppointmentItem** object associated with a **MeetingItem** object, and work directly with the **AppointmentItem** object to respond to the request.


## Example

The following example uses the  ** [CreateItem](e5fbf367-db16-5042-823e-68e6b805e612.md)**method to create an appointment. It becomes a  **MeetingItem** with both a required and an optional attendee when it is received in the inbox of each of the recipients.


```
Set myItem = myOlApp.CreateItem(olAppointmentItem) 
 
myItem.MeetingStatus = olMeeting 
 
myItem.Subject = "Strategy Meeting" 
 
myItem.Location = "Conference Room B" 
 
myItem.Start = #9/24/97 1:30:00 PM# 
 
myItem.Duration = 90 
 
Set myRequiredAttendee = myItem.Recipients.Add("Nate _ 
 
 Sun") 
 
myRequiredAttendee.Type = olRequired 
 
Set myOptionalAttendee = myItem.Recipients.Add("Kevin _ 
 
 Kennedy") 
 
myOptionalAttendee.Type = olOptional 
 
Set myResourceAttendee = _ 
 
 myItem.Recipients.Add("Conference Room B") 
 
myResourceAttendee.Type = olResource 
 
myItem.Send
```
