# Views Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains a collection of all  ** [View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)** objects in the current folder.

## Remarks

Use the  **Views** property of the ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object to return the **Views** collection. Use **Views**( _index_),where  _index_ is the object's name or position within the collection, to return a single **View** object.

Use the  ** [Add](8005ca2e-8b28-1286-74d1-448f2a168c65.md)** method of the views collection to add a new view to the collection.

Use the  ** [Remove](73a92be6-8dc4-6fb9-7f20-0ff678445737.md)** method to remove a view from the collection.


## Example

The following example returns a  **View** object of type **olTableView** called Table View. Before running this example, make sure a view by the name 'Table View' exists.


```
Sub GetView() 
 
 'Returns a view called Table View 
 
 Dim objName As NameSpace 
 
 Dim objViews As Views 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 Set objName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set objViews = objName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox).Views 
 
 'Return a view called Table View 
 
 Set objView = objViews.Item("Table View") 
 
End Sub
```

The following example adds a new view of type  **olIconView** in the user's Notes folder.


 **Note**  The  **Add** method will fail if a view with the same name already exists.




```
Sub CreateView() 
 
 'Creates a new view 
 
 Dim objName As NameSpace 
 
 Dim objViews As Views 
 
 Dim objNewView As View 
 
 
 
 Set objName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set objViews = objName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderNotes).Views 
 
 Set objNewView = objViews.Add(Name:="New Icon View Type", _ 
 
 ViewType:=olIconView, SaveOption:=olViewSaveOptionThisFolderEveryone) 
 
 
 
End Sub
```

 The following example removes the above view, "New Icon View Type", from the collection.




```
Sub DeleteView() 
 
 'Deletes a view from the collection 
 
 Dim objName As NameSpace 
 
 Dim objViews As Views 
 
 Dim objNewView As View 
 
 
 
 Set objName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set objViews = objName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderNotes).Views 
 
 objViews.Remove ("New Icon View Type") 
 
End Sub
```
