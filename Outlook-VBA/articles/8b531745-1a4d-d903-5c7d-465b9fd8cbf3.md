# AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a constant from the  ** [OlRuleConditionType](35c2f965-0f9d-8cc8-2f05-60522268574f.md)** enumeration that indicates the type of rule condition. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ConditionType**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **AddressRuleCondition** object.


## Remarks

The  ** [AddressRuleCondition](8cf897ad-a8f9-67ea-c0fa-d7f4bb917bd4.md)** object is used by rules of types **olRuleSend** and **olRuleReceive**. If the rule is created as an  **olRuleSend** rule, then the type of the associated **AddressRuleCondition** object will be **olConditionSenderAddress**. If the rule is created as an  **olRuleReceive** rule, then the type of the associated **AddressRuleCondition** object will be **olConditionRecipientAddress**. 

This however does not mean that the rule always has a defined rule condition for sender or recipient addresses. Regardless of whether there exists such a defined or enabled rule condition, the  **AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType** property is always initialized once the associated rule is created. For more information on rule conditions, see [Specify Rule Conditions](812c131a-fe23-1b8b-5e2d-9459d7102630.md).
