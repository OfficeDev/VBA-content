# ScrollBar Object (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets the value of another control based on the position of the scroll box.

## Remarks

A  **ScrollBar** is a stand-alone control you can place on a form. It is visually like the scroll bar you see in certain objects such as a ** [ListBox](f56ba480-f8fe-6d12-265e-3b0a9838af97.md)** or the drop-down portion of a ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. However, unlike the scroll bars in these controls, the stand-alone  **ScrollBar** is not an integral part of any other control.

To use the  **ScrollBar** to set or read the value of another control, you must write code that uses the **ScrollBar** control's ** [Value](816e7e02-166c-e36e-4d0c-3e0af0187fe6.md)** property. For example, to use the **ScrollBar** to update the value of a ** [TextBox](4a0e4a3d-beca-9f94-7e27-469c4bafe250.md)**, you can write code that reads the  **Value** property of the **ScrollBar** and then sets the ** [Value](816e7e02-166c-e36e-4d0c-3e0af0187fe6.md)** property of the **TextBox**.

The default property for a  **ScrollBar** is the **Value** property.

To create a horizontal or vertical  **ScrollBar**, drag the sizing handles of the  **ScrollBar** horizontally or vertically on the form.
