# ComboBox.SelLength Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Long** that represents the number of characters selected in the text portion of a ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelLength**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

For  **SelLength** and ** [SelStart](cf739c9f-6c3a-d4fd-780b-6e6ee4559ec9.md)**, the valid range of settings is 0 to the total number of characters in the edit area of a  **ComboBox**.

The  **SelLength** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus. Setting **SelLength** to a value less than zero creates an error. Attempting to set **SelLength** to a value greater than the number of characters available in a control results in a value equal to the number of characters in the control.

Changing the value of the  **SelStart** property cancels any existing selection in the control, places an insertion point in the text, and sets **SelLength** to zero.

The default value, zero, means that no text is currently selected.
