# Control Toolbox Overview

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  [Control Toolbox](f9ef4ea1-a403-040a-e162-1bcf263a027f.md) identifies the controls that you can add to a **Frame** or a page of a form.

You can customize the  **Control Toolbox** in many ways including the following:


- Add pages to the  **Control Toolbox**. 
    
- Move controls from one page in the  **Control Toolbox** to another.
    
- Rename  **Control Toolbox** pages.
    
- Add other controls, including ActiveX controls, to the  **Control Toolbox**. 
    
- Copy modified controls from the form to the  **Control Toolbox**. For example,  **OK** and **Cancel** buttons are special types of [CommandButtons](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md). If you copy  **OK** and **Cancel** templates to the **Control Toolbox**, you can quickly add them to other forms.
    

 **Note**  When you add a control to a form by using the  **Control Toolbox**, the control is not bound to a field.
