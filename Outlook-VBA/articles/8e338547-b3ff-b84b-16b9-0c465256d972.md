# Binding a Control to a Field

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

If you have created a control using the  **Control Toolbox** and you would like the information in this control to be saved with the form, the control must be bound to a field. This means that a link will be established between the control and the source of data, in this case, a field in the item.

1. In the Forms Designer, right-click the control you want to bind to a field and then click  **Properties** on the shortcut menu.
    
2. On the  **Value** tab, click **Choose Field**, point to a field set, and then click the field to which you want to bind the control. If you would like to bind the control to a new field that you create, click  **New**. In the  **New Field** box, type the name of your new field in the **Name**: area. Click  **OK** in the **New Field** box.
    
3. Click  **OK** in the **Properties** box.
    

 **Note**  If you bind a  ** [CheckBox](1834855b-f96c-aaa1-24ce-81d1e4e4e1db.md)**,  ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**,  ** [ListBox](f56ba480-f8fe-6d12-265e-3b0a9838af97.md)**, or  ** [OptionButton](8009dd64-44b5-3b66-e8d4-e3535e014396.md)** to a field, then the **Click** event does not fire. You need to use the **PropertyChange** or **CustomPropertyChange** event of the item to detect the change via code, as shown in the following example:




```
Sub Item_PropertyChange(ByVal Name) 
Set MyListBox = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("Message").Controls("ListBox1") 
Select Case Name 
 Case "Mileage" 
 Item.CC = MyListBox.Value 
 Item.Subject = MyListBox.Value 
 Case Else 
End Select 
End Sub
```
