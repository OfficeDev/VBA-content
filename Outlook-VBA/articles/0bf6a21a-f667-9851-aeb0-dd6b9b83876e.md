## Remarks

Returns the reply as a  ** [MailItem](14197346-05d2-0250-fa4c-4a6b07daf25f.md)** object.

In Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), if you set the return value of this function to  **False**, the reply action is not completed and the new item is not displayed.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  **Reply**event and sets the  **Sent Items** folder for the reply item to the folder in which the original item resides. To use this example, open an existing mailitem, run the `Initialize Handler()` procedure, then reply to the open item.


```
Public WithEvents myItem As MailItem 
 
 
 
Sub Initialize_Handler() 
 
 Set myItem = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myItem_Reply(ByVal Response As Object, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Set Response.SaveSentMessageFolder = myItem.Parent 
 
End Sub
```
