# PostItem.EntryID Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  **String** representing the unique Entry ID of the object. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **EntryID**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PostItem** object.


## Remarks

This property corresponds to the MAPI property  **PidTagEntryId**.

A MAPI store provider assigns a unique ID string when an item is created in its store. Therefore, the  **EntryID** property is not set for an Outlook item until it is saved or sent. The Entry ID changes when an item is moved into another store, for example, from your **Inbox** to a Microsoft Exchange Server public folder, or from one Personal Folders (.pst) file to another .pst file. Solutions should not depend on the **EntryID** property to be unique unless items will not be moved. The **EntryID** property returns a MAPI long-term Entry ID. For more information about long- and short-term EntryIDs, search http://msdn.microsoft.com for **PidTagEntryId**.
