Actions are a very powerful feature of forms in Microsoft Outlook that you can use to create a wide variety of solutions without writing code. For example, you can use actions to open other forms, even forms of a different type, or you can create a message form with an action that opens a contact form.


## Forms customized with form regions

You can specify custom actions for a form region. To create an action that suits your needs, you can either modify a built-in action or create a new custom action. For more information, see  [How to: Create a Custom Action for a Form Region](bf889270-3e80-a240-15e4-c57a3f1e7b9b.md).
