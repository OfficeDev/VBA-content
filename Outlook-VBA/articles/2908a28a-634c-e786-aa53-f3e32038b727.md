# TaskRequestItem Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a change to the recipient's Tasks list initiated by another party or as a result of a group tasking.

## Remarks

Unlike other Microsoft Outlook objects, you cannot create this object. When the sender applies the  ** [Assign](f254107a-4182-de3a-2039-08f664e61eeb.md)**and  ** [Send](54f751fc-cff1-5d17-f635-f688cd8ad6f8.md)**methods to a  ** [TaskItem](5df8cfa5-5460-a5a1-a130-ba5bca1a0091.md)**object to assign (delegate) the associated task to another user, the  **TaskRequestItem** object is created when the item is received in the recipient's Inbox.

Use the  ** [GetAssociatedTask](ec170266-9898-79d8-03e9-7ea38d789d40.md)**method to return the  **TaskItem** object, and work directly with the **TaskItem** object to respond to the request.


## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example creates a simple task, assigns it to another user, and sends it. When the task request arrives in the recipient's Inbox, it is received as a  **TaskRequestItem**.






```
Sub SendTask() 
 
 Dim myItem As Outlook.TaskItem 
 
 Dim myDelegate As Outlook.Recipient 
 
 
 
 Set myItem = Application.CreateItem(olTaskItem) 
 
 myItem.Assign 
 
 Set myDelegate = myItem.Recipients.Add("Jeff Smith") 
 
 myItem.Subject = "Prepare Agenda For Meeting" 
 
 myItem.DueDate = #9/20/97# 
 
 myItem.Send 
 
End Sub
```
