Use this procedure to add a control from the  [Control Toolbox](0dac9ed6-d9d5-1c3b-cfd2-ce564e5dc6e2.md) to your form. You can also use this procedure to insert a control in a ** [Frame](5fb494d3-8e00-852a-c361-0e99358b1ce8.md)**,  ** [TabStrip](643c896a-2304-42f3-f5e9-0feee6d22364.md)**, or  ** [MultiPage](ac0fa233-81fe-8a34-4113-6907c6d8f7e2.md)** on the form.


1. In an open form on the  **Developer** tab, in the **Tools** group, click **Control Toolbox**.
    
     **Note**  If you do not see the  **Developer** tab in the open form, see the topic [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](8f81b1ce-333d-d9be-2af7-cfc65bf15e22.md).
2. Do one of the following:
    
      - Click a control in the  **Control Toolbox** and then click in the form. The control appears in its default size. You can then drag the border of the control to change its size.
    
  - Drag a control from the  **Control Toolbox** to the form. The control appears in its default size.
    
  - Double-click the control in the  **Control Toolbox**, and then click in the form once for each control that you want to create. For example, to create four command buttons, double-click the  [CommandButton](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md) control in the **Control Toolbox**, and then click four times in the form.
