The following code sample shows how to create a mail item, allow the user to select recipients from the Exchange Global Address List in the  **Select Names** dialog box, and if the user has selected recipients that can be completely resolved, then send the mail item.


```
Sub SelectRecipients() 
 Dim oMsg As MailItem 
 Set oMsg = Application.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 Dim oDialog As SelectNamesDialog 
 Set oDialog = Application.Session.GetSelectNamesDialog 
 With oDialog 
 .InitialAddressList = _ 
 Application.Session.GetGlobalAddressList 
 .Recipients = oMsg.Recipients 
 If .Display Then 
 'Recipients Resolved 
 oMsg.Subject = "Hello" 
 oMsg.Send 
 End If 
 End With
