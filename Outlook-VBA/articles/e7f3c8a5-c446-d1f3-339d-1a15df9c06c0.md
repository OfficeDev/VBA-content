There are two types of properties for a control: Outlook properties and advanced properties. Outlook properties are the basic properties needed to design a control. Advanced properties offer additional functionality.

Outlook properties are set in the  **Properties** dialog box and must be set individually. Advanced properties are set in the **Advanced Properties** dialog box and can be set for multiple controls at once.
