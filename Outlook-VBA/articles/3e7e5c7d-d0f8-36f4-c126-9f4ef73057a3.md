# Creating a New Item

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

To create a new item, use the  ** [CreateItem](e5fbf367-db16-5042-823e-68e6b805e612.md)** method of the ** [Application](797003e7-ecd1-eccb-eaaf-32d6ddde8348.md)** object. This method returns an object that you can then use to work with the item.

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications example shows how to create a mail message, add text to its subject and body, and display it. To use this sample, create a command button named Command1 on a form.



```
Private Sub Command1_Click() 
 Dim myOLItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 Set myOLItem = Application.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 With myOLItem 
 .Subject = "Sample item" 
 .Body = "This is a sample message." 
 End With 
 myOLItem.Display 
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to perform the same task using VBScript in a form.



```
Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 Set myOLItem = Application.CreateItem(0) 
 myOLItem.Subject = "Sample item" 
 myOLItem.Body = "This is a sample message." 
 myOLItem.Display 
End Sub
```
