# CommandButton.TakeFocusOnClick Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that specifies whether a control takes the focus when clicked. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **TakeFocusOnClick**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandButton** object.


## Remarks

 **True** if the button takes the focus when clicked (default). **False** if the button does not take the focus when clicked.

The  **TakeFocusOnClick** property defines only what happens when the user clicks a control. If the user tabs to the control, the control takes the focus regardless of the value of **TakeFocusOnClick**.

Use this property to complete actions that affect a control without requiring that control to give up focus. For example, assume your form includes a  ** [TextBox](4a0e4a3d-beca-9f94-7e27-469c4bafe250.md)** and a ** [CommandButton](bb2bcfaa-e7a5-cedc-2ed7-bcc17a4d8fb6.md)** that checks for correct spelling of text. You would like to be able to select text in the **TextBox**, then click the  **CommandButton** and run the spelling checker without taking focus away from the **TextBox**. You can do this by setting the  **TakeFocusOnClick** property of the **CommandButton** to **False**.
