```
Sub ResetInboxViews() 
 
 
 
 Dim objName As NameSpace 
 
 Dim objViews As Views 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 ' Get the Views collection of the Inbox default folder. 
 
 Set objName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set objViews = objName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox).Views 
 
 
 
 ' Enumerate the Views collection, calling the Reset 
 
 ' method for each View object with its Standard 
 
 ' property value set to True. 
 
 For Each objView In objViews 
 
 If objView.Standard = True Then
