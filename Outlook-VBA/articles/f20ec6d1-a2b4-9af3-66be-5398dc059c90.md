 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)

 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs when an instance of the parent object is opened for editing by the user. 


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Read**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **MailItem** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **Read** event differs from the ** [Open](656c16f7-d561-a8f7-e859-9ac24f357769.md)** event in that **Read** occurs whenever the user selects the item in a view that supports in-cell editing as well as when the item is being opened in an ** [Inspector](d7384756-669c-0549-1032-c3b864187994.md)**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  **Read**event to increment a counter that tracks how often an item is read.


```
Public WithEvents myItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 
 
Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myItem = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Items(1) 
 
 myItem.Display 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub myItem_Read() 
 
 Dim myProperty As Outlook.UserProperty 
 
 Set myProperty = myItem.UserProperties("ReadCount") 
 
 If (myProperty Is Nothing) Then 
 
 Set myProperty = myItem.UserProperties.Add("ReadCount", olNumber) 
 
 End If 
 
 myProperty.Value = myProperty.Value + 1 
 
 myItem.Save 
 
End Sub
```
