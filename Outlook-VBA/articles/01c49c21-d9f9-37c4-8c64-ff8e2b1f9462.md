# Items.GetNext Method (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the next object in the collection. 

## Syntax

 _expression_. **GetNext**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Items** object.


### Return Value

An  **Object** value that represents the next object contained by the collection.


## Remarks

It returns  **Nothing** if no next object exists, for example, if already positioned at the end of the collection. To ensure correct operation of the ** [GetFirst](142a6174-118e-6256-0511-8ae9e142e555.md)**,  ** [GetLast](d02a20be-19fc-fb6e-feff-b66ca0273beb.md)**,  **GetNext**, and  ** [GetPrevious](5dde47f8-2bd8-fdbe-d6e7-b1381e8a97a6.md)** methods in a large collection, call **GetFirst** before calling **GetNext** on that collection, and call **GetLast** before calling **GetPrevious**. To ensure that you are always making the calls on the same collection, create an explicit variable that refers to that collection before entering the loop.
