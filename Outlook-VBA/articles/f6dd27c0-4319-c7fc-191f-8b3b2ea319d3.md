## Remarks

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  ** [Count](ea7a19d2-6261-ce07-97f3-ebe95489a265.md)**property and  ** [Item](981b107a-14d7-2dd3-6449-2737b2801c3c.md)**method of the  ** [Selection](0b06a3ce-0445-db8f-e6e8-bb7bd469c50f.md)**collection returned by the  **Selection** property to display the senders of all mail items selected in the active explorer window. To run this example, you need to have at least one mail item selected in the active Explorer window.


 **Note**  You might receive an error if you select items other than a mail item such as task request as the  **SenderName** property does not exist for a **TaskRequestItem** object.


```
Sub GetSelectedItems() 
 
 Dim myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 Dim myOlSel As Outlook.Selection 
 
 Dim MsgTxt As String 
 
 Dim x As Integer 
 
 
 
 MsgTxt = "You have selected items from: " 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
 Set myOlSel = myOlExp.Selection 
 
 For x = 1 To myOlSel.Count 
 
 MsgTxt = MsgTxt &amp; myOlSel.Item(x).SenderName &amp; ";" 
 
 Next x 
 
 MsgBox MsgTxt 
 
End Sub
```
