# Filtering Items Using a Variable

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use values from variables as part of a filter in Microsoft Jet syntax or DAV Searching and Locating (DASL) syntax. The following example illustrates the use of variables as part of a filter: 



```
fullname = "Dan Wilson" 
' This approach uses Chr(34) to delimit the value.  
criteria = "[FullName] = " &amp; Chr(34) &amp; fullname _ &amp; Chr(34) 
' This approach uses the double quotation mark to delimit the value.  
criteria = "[FullName] = """ &amp; fullname &amp; """" 
' This approach uses the escaped hexadecimal value of the double quotation mark to delimit the value.  
criteria = "[FullName] = "%22" &amp; fullname &amp; "%22"" 

```
