# Views.ViewAdd Event (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Occurs when a view is added to the collection. Microsoft Outlook creates the new view and passes it to this event.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ViewAdd**( **_View_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Views** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|View|Required| ** [View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)**|The new view added to the collection prior to this event.|

## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example displays the view's name and saves it when the  **ViewAdd** event is fired. Use the ** [Save](effc4046-2e9c-3898-e37f-c4de817ddde7.md)**method after the properties have been modified to save the changes to the view. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `AddView()` procedure should be called before the event procedure can be called by Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents objViews As Outlook.Views 
 
 
 
Sub AddView() 
 
 Dim objView As Outlook.View 
 
 Set objViews = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Views 
 
 Set objView = objViews.Add("Latest View1", olTableView, olViewSaveOptionAllFoldersOfType) 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub objViews_ViewAdd(ByVal View As View) 
 
'Displays name of new view 
 
 With View 
 
 Msgbox .Name &amp; " was created programmatically." 
 
 .Save 
 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
