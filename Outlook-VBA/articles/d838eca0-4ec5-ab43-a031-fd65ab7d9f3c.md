 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Saves all rules in the  ** [Rules](dd41b4de-bf5f-5532-46c9-394a5d078bec.md)** collection.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Save**( **_ShowProgress_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Rules** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ShowProgress|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** to display the progress dialog box, **False** to save rules without showing the progress.|

## Remarks

After you enable a rule, you must also save the rule by using  **Rules.Save** so that the rule and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.

 **Rules.Save** can be an expensive operation in terms of performance on slow connections to Exchange server. For more information on using the progress dialog box, see [Manage Rules in the Outlook Object Model](05ddd643-e9bd-a37d-b680-b8519960a5f6.md).

Saving rules that are incompatible or have improperly defined actions or conditions (such as an empty string for  ** [TextRuleCondition.Text](615f47e9-2c43-a473-33f6-46765ccd3903.md)**) will return an error.

The Exchange server limits the maximum number of rules that can be supported by a store.  **Rules.Save** returns an error when this limit is reached.
