 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs when one or more items are added to the specified collection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ItemAdd**( **_Item_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Results** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Item|Required| **Object**|The item that was added.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event does not run when a large number of items are added to the folder at once. It is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

In this Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example, when a new contact is added to the  **Contacts** folder, the contact item is attached to an e-mail message and sent to a distribution list named "Sales Team". The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents myOlItems As Outlook.Items 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlItems = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").GetDefaultFolder(olFolderContacts).Items 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlItems_ItemAdd(ByVal Item As Object) 
 
 Dim myOlMItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 Dim myOlAtts As Outlook.Attachments 
 
 Set myOlMItem = myOlApp.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 
 myOlMItem.Save 
 
 
 
 Set myOlAtts = myOlMItem.Attachments 
 
 ' Add new contact to attachments in mail message 
 
 myOlAtts.Add Item, olByValue 
 
 myOlMItem.To = "Sales Team" 
 
 myOlMItem.Subject = "New contact" 
 
 myOlMItem.Send 
 
End Sub
```
