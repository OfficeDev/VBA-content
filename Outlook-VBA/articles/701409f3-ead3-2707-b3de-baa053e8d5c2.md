 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs whenever a new explorer window is opened, either as a result of user action or through program code. 


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **NewExplorer**( **_Explorer_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Explorers** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Explorer|Required| ** [Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)**|The explorer that was opened.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).

The event occurs after the new  ** [Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)**object is created but before the explorer window appears.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example minimizes the currently active explorer window when a new explorer is about to appear. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents myOlExplorers As Outlook.Explorers 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExplorers = Application.Explorers 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExplorers_NewExplorer(ByVal Explorer As Outlook.Explorer) 
 
 If TypeName(Application.ActiveExplorer) <> "Nothing" Then 
 
 Application.ActiveExplorer.WindowState = olMinimized 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
