# ComboBox.SelStart Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Long** that represents the starting point of selected text, or the insertion point if no text is selected. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelStart**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

For  ** [SelLength](0fda7952-032c-1b2d-03aa-870fe3afc757.md)** and **SelStart**, the valid range of settings is 0 to the total number of characters in the edit area of a  ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. The default value is zero.

The  **SelStart** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus. Setting **SelStart** to a value less than zero creates an error. Attempting to set **SelStart** to a value greater than the number of characters available in a control results in a value equal to the number of characters in the control.

Changing the value of  **SelStart** cancels any existing selection in the control, places an insertion point in the text, and sets the **SelLength** property to zero.
