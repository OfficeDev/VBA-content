# ComboBox.CurX Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Long** that represents the current horizontal position of the insertion point in a multiline ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **CurX**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The  **CurX** property applies to a multiline **ComboBox**. The return value is valid when the object has the focus.

You can use  ** [CurTargetX](a12c1ba9-eca1-4a3f-89e4-1559b5e4b00c.md)** and **CurX** to position the insertion point as the user scrolls through the contents of a multiline **ComboBox**. When the user moves the insertion point to another line of text by scrolling the content of the object,  **CurTargetX** specifies the preferred position for the insertion point. **CurX** is set to this value if the line of text is longer than the value of **CurTargetX**. Otherwise,  **CurX** is set to the end of the line of text.
