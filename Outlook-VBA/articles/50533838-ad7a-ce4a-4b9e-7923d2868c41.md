 _expression_A variable that represents a  **StorageItem** object.


## Remarks

This property corresponds to the MAPI property,  **PidTagSubject**. The  **Subject** property is the default property for Outlook items.

The  **Subject** serves as a unique identifier for ** [StorageItem](41776bc3-b838-2755-fd6b-3b5012fb9ae5.md)** objects. You should set the subject in a way to ensure that the objects are unique and would not be overwritten by other solution writers. The recommended practice is to use a **ProgID** plus other unique text to identify the **StorageItem**.
