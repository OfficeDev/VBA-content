# Page Object (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents one page of a  ** [MultiPage](ac0fa233-81fe-8a34-4113-6907c6d8f7e2.md)** or a single member of a ** [Pages](20a5339d-1dc7-9b61-d725-d13db72c5f65.md)** collection.

## Remarks

Each  **Page** object contains its own set of controls and does not necessarily rely on other pages in the collection for information. A **Page** inherits some properties from its container; the value of each inherited property is set by the container.

You can reference a  **Page** by its index value. The index value reflects the ordinal position of the **Page** within the collection. The index of the first **Page** in a collection is 0; the index of the second **Page** is 1; and so on.

The default name for the first  **Page** is Page1. The default name for the second **Page** is Page2.
