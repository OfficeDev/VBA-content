# FormRegionStartup Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Defines an interface that allows an add-in to specify the storage and the user interface of a form region, obtains an object for that form region, and determines when the form region is about to be displayed in a form or in the Reading Pane.

## Remarks

The  **FormRegionStartup** interface is an abstract class, which means that it cannot be instantiated directly. In Visual Basic, you can use the **Implements** keyword to provide the methods of **FormRegionStartup** in your add-in class as follows:


```
Implements Outlook.FormRegionStartup
```

An add-in deploying a form region in an Outlook form on a client computer must implement the  **FormRegionStartup** interface which consists of the two methods, ** [BeforeFormRegionShow](c93c2f6a-511f-15cd-eca2-4eb35af9939a.md)** and ** [GetFormRegionStorage](685b5ed7-dd19-9040-664f-5deff6e738c7.md)**. When Outlook loads the add-in, Outlook queries the  **IDTExtensibility2** interface for **FormRegionStartup**. 

The add-in indicates the storage and layout file for the form region in  **GetFormRegionStorage**. By calling  **GetFormRegionStorage**, Outlook allocates storage and calculates the layout for the form region, instantiates an object for the form region, and returns a value representing the storage allocated to the add-in. If  **GetFormRegionStorage** is successful, just before the form region is displayed in an Inspector window or in the Reading Pane, Outlook will call **BeforeFormRegionShow** and pass the ** [FormRegion](3a0b83eb-4076-9cb3-86a9-68f9e44df89f.md)** object of the form region to the add-in. The add-in uses this opportunity before the form region is displayed to update any controls in the form region.

When the add-in closes the frame for the form region, the add-in must release the object for the form region.

For more information on writing add-ins for form regions, see  [Extending a Form Region with an Add-in](b1a28a20-a0b8-cc57-7672-da51ec8bb097.md). For examples of add-ins in C# and Visual Basic .NET that implement  **FormRegionStartup**, see code sample downloads on MSDN.
