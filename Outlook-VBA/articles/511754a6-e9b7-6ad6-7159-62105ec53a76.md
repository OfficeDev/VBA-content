 _**Applies to:** Outlook 2013_

Outlook provides several ways to add custom properties:



|| ** [UserProperties.Add](88b86622-2234-77be-41e7-b76b0b3a75ad.md)**| ** [ItemProperties.Add](317daeba-e34c-8458-2492-c434707fa805.md)**| ** [PropertyAccessor.SetProperty](2a97c11d-3f5f-65fe-23d6-8efa40dca303.md)**| ** [PropertyAccessor.SetProperties](bf7c86da-5146-9567-5b7e-3e5e63ee5587.md)**|
| **Action**|Adds a custom property specified by  _Name_ and _Type_. If a property of the same name and type already exists, it will be overwritten by a new property. The default value for  _AddToFolderFields_ allows adding the property to the item and as a view field to the folder.|Adds a custom property specified by  _Name_ and _Type_ even if a property of the same name and type already exists. The default value for _AddToFolderFields_ allows adding the property to the item and as a view field to the folder.|Adds a custom property specified by  _SchemaName_ if the provider and the parent object supports property creation, the property does not already exist, and a valid schema name is specified for the property.|For each property in  _SchemaNames_,  ** [PropertyAccessor.SetProperties](bf7c86da-5146-9567-5b7e-3e5e63ee5587.md)** adds it as a custom property if the provider and the parent object supports property creation, the property does not already exist, and a valid schema name is specified for the property.|
| ** Applicable Objects**|All  [Outlook item objects](6ea4babf-facf-4018-ef5a-4a484e55153a.md) except Microsoft Office document items ( ** [DocumentItem](7b0a6af0-6632-3ff6-841f-5b081d0d68d8.md)** objects)|All Outlook item objects except Microsoft Office document items ( **DocumentItem** objects)|All Outlook item objects including  **DocumentItem** objects.|All Outlook item objects including  **DocumentItem** objects.|
| **Property Initial Value**| **Empty** in VBA; requires subsequent assignment| **Empty** in VBA; requires subsequent assignment|Specified by  _Value_.|Specified by the value of the corresponding element in the  _Values_ array|
| **Property Type**|Specified by  _Type_|Specified by  _Type_|If the property is specified by the MAPI proptag or id namespace, the property type is contained in the lowest 16 bits of the identifier; otherwise the property type is determined by the type of  _Value_.|Type of each property is determined by the same principles as in the  **SetProperty** column; where the property is not specified by any namespace involving its proptag, its property type is the type of the corresponding element in the _Values_ array.|
| **Upon Property Change**|The  **CustomPropertyChange** event will fire on property change.|The  **CustomPropertyChange** event will fire on property change.|An item-level property added this way does not become part of the item's  ** [UserProperties](20b49c86-d74f-9bda-382c-559af278c148.md)** collection. It will not generate Outlook Object Model events when it is changed.|Same event considerations as in the  **SetProperty** column.|
