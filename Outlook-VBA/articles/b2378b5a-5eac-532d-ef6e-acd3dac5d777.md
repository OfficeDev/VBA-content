# Task Forms Overview

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You cannot customize the default pages of a task form by using Microsoft Outlook form pages. However, you can hide these pages and create new pages on the form.

By using form regions, you can customize the default pages of a form by adding an adjoining form region. For more information, see  [form regions](66e80f83-60db-e3b1-47e9-097f855f6512.md).

When tasks are used in a personal folder, you can assign tasks to other people. However, when task items are placed in a Microsoft Exchange public folder, they cannot be assigned. Instead, the  **Owner** field can be modified to reflect who currently owns the task. It is recommended that you create a custom view so that the tasks are grouped by their owner.
