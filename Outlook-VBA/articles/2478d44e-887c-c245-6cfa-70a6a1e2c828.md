 _expression_A variable that represents a  **FormRegion** object.


## Remarks

The internal name is required for a form region. The <name> tag in the corresponding form region manifest XML file maps to the value of the  **InternalName** property. For more information on the XML schema for form regions, see the Microsoft Outlook 2010 XML Schema Reference in the [MSDN Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library).

The value of the  **InternalName** property is used by the add-in or Microsoft Outlook to refer to the form region, for example, to determine which form region is being loaded or to load strings from the localized string resources. The **InternalName** property supports only ASCII characters. The string is case-insensitive, and its maximum length is 256 characters.
