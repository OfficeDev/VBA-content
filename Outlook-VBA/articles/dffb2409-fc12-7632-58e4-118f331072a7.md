# ComboBox.EnterFieldBehavior Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets an  **Integer** that specifies the selection behavior when entering a ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **EnterFieldBehavior**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The possible values of  **EnterFieldBehavior** are 0 and 1. 0 represents selecting the entire contents of the edit region when entering the control (default). 1 represents leaving the selection unchanged. Visually, this uses the selection that was in effect the last time the control was active.

The  **EnterFieldBehavior** property controls the way text is selected when the user tabs to the control, not when the control receives focus as a result of the **SetFocus** method. Following **SetFocus**, the contents of the control are not selected and the insertion point appears after the last character in the control's edit region.

You can combine the effects of the  **EnterFieldBehavior** property and ** [DragBehavior](768d8995-2f6c-5915-7fbb-46b2b3114131.md)** to create a large number of combo box styles.
