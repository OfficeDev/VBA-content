# OptionButton.BackStyle Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets an  **Integer** that specifies the background style for an object. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **BackStyle**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **OptionButton** object.


## Remarks

The possible values are 0 and 1. 0 represents the background as transparent, 1 represents the background as opaque.

The  **BackStyle** property determines whether a control is transparent. If **BackStyle** is 1, the control is not transparent and you cannot see anything behind the control on a form. If **BackStyle** is 0, you can see through the control and look at anything on the form located behind the control. The ** [BackColor](034dad2e-9eb7-8943-eb3c-1750fe9f3051.md)** property is only valid if the **BackStyle** property is set to 1.

 **BackStyle** does not affect the transparency of bitmaps. You must use a picture editor such as Paintbrush to make a bitmap transparent. Not all controls support transparent bitmaps.
