 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  **String** value that represents a unique global identifier for the ** [AppointmentItem](204a409d-654e-27aa-643a-8344c631b82d.md)** object. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **GlobalAppointmentID**

 _expression_An expression that returns an  **AppointmentItem** object.


## Remarks

There are situations where the entry ID of  **AppointmentItem** objects may change, such as when an item is moved to a different folder or to a different store. Entry IDs can also change when a user performs certain functions in Outlook, such as exporting and then reimporting data.

Therefore, each Outlook appointment item is assigned a Global Object ID, a unique global identifier which does not change during those situations. The Global Object ID is a MAPI property that Outlook uses to correlate meeting updates and responses with a particular meeting on the calendar. The Global Object ID is the same across all copies of the item.
