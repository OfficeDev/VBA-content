 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  **String** value that represents the name of the ** [Column](b7eb6916-2d80-57c3-2077-47a2a4c73185.md)**. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Name**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Column** object.


## Remarks

The  **Name** property is the default member of the **Column** object.

If the  **Column** is a default column in the ** [Table](0affaafd-93fe-227a-acee-e09a86cadc20.md)**, or if it has been added to the  **Table** with the explicit built-in name for the property, the value of **Name** is the explicit built-in name (without any enclosing brackets) for the property. If the **Column** has been added to the **Table** with a property name referencing a namespace, the value of **Name** will be the property name referenced by namespace. For more information on referencing properties by namespace, see [Referencing Properties by Namespace](c1c7bfa9-64d7-81d2-84e7-f0a4c57780b3.md).
