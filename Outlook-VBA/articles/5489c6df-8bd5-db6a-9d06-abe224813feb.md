# StorageItem.EntryID Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  **String** representing the unique Entry ID of the object. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **EntryID**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **StorageItem** object.


## Remarks

The EntryID is one of the three means to identify a  ** [StorageItem](41776bc3-b838-2755-fd6b-3b5012fb9ae5.md)** object using ** [Folder.GetStorage](cc5ee63b-7d11-6340-8392-8b35a689a28c.md)**.

This property corresponds to the MAPI property  **PidTagEntryId**.

A MAPI store provider assigns a unique ID string when an item is created in its store. Therefore, the  **EntryID** property is not set for an Outlook item until it is saved or sent. The Entry ID changes when an item is moved into another store, for example, from your **Inbox** to a Microsoft Exchange Server public folder, or from one Personal Folders (.pst) file to another .pst file. Solutions should not depend on the **EntryID** property to be unique unless items will not be moved. The **EntryID** property returns a MAPI long-term Entry ID. For more information about long- and short-term EntryIDs, search http://msdn.microsoft.com for **PidTagEntryId**.
