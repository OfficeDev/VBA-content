 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Enabled**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CategoryRuleCondition** object.


## Remarks

After you enable a rule condition, you must also save the rule by using  ** [Rules.Save](d838eca0-4ec5-ab43-a031-fd65ab7d9f3c.md)** so that the rule condition and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule condition is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.
