# Results Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains data and results returned by the  ** [Search](226a5d49-3caf-90dd-725c-265404d1939f.md)** object and the ** [AdvancedSearch](7b433d8b-08b9-dff1-b854-287d76b47a90.md)** method.

## Remarks

The  **Results** object contains properties and methods that allow you to view and manipulate data. For example the ** [GetNext](3667738a-fcae-b786-e8d4-e478b1614c8c.md)**,  ** [GetPrevious](be9877c4-602d-7e2d-a00b-edb4aead7441.md)**,  ** [GetFirst](9a8b56ce-5e93-f1b1-be7f-7734d86f4997.md)**, and  ** [GetLast](90a50739-b9a9-92de-516b-1cd9f3fe8d50.md)** methods allow you to search through the results and view the data by field. The ** [Sort](d897f4c9-ef58-cdb4-ca9e-d179af12f2b5.md)** method allows you to sort the data.

Use the  **SearchObject.Results** property to return a **Results** object.


## Example

The following event procedure stores the results of a search in a variable named objRsts and displays the results of the search in the Immediate window.


```
Private Sub Application_AdvancedSearchComplete(ByVal SearchObject As Search) 
 
 
 
 Dim objRsts As Outlook.Results 
 
 MsgBox "The search " &amp; SearchObject.Tag &amp; _ 
 
 "has completed. The scope of the search was " &amp; _ 
 
 SearchObject.Scope &amp; "." 
 
 Set objRsts = SearchObject.Results 
 
 'Print out number in Results collection 
 
 Debug.Print objRsts.Count 
 
 'Print out each member of Results collection 
 
 For Each Item In objRsts 
 
 Debug.Print Item 
 
 Next 
 
 
 
End Sub 
 

```
