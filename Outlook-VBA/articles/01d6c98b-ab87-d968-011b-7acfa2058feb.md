# ComboBox.MatchRequired Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that specifies whether a value entered in the text portion of a ** [ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)** must match an entry in the existing list portion of the control. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **MatchRequired**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The user can enter non-matching values, but may not leave the control until a matching value is entered.

 **True** if the text entered must match an existing list entry. **False** if the text entered can be different from all existing list entries (default).

If the  **MatchRequired** property is **True**, the user cannot exit the  **ComboBox** until the text entered matches an entry in the existing list. **MatchRequired** maintains the integrity of the list by requiring the user to select an existing entry.

Not all containers enforce this property.
