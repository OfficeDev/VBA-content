 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

This topic describes the entry points to search items in folders and access search results.


|| ** [Application.AdvancedSearch](7b433d8b-08b9-dff1-b854-287d76b47a90.md)**| ** [Explorer.Search](d4dc7ae5-c24f-90df-f52e-e0b73293e25d.md)**| ** [Search.GetTable](3aba6b77-73a3-9620-9c18-b2e03c7b63bc.md)**|
| **Purpose**|Provides programmatic search on items in a specified folder based on a filter.|Performs a programmatic content indexer search that is analogous to a user executing a search from the Outlook user interface. |Provides an efficient way to access items (in a  ** [Table](0affaafd-93fe-227a-acee-e09a86cadc20.md)**) returned by a prior  **Application.AdvancedSearch**. This entry point does not carry out a separate search.|
| **Scope of Search**|Folder specified as a search parameter.|Determined by the parameter  _SearchAllItems_. If  _SearchAllItems_ is True, the method will search across all folders that have the same folder type as the current folder (specified by the ** [DefaultItemType](5a08d9aa-6bb7-0917-6d46-cb27cd03dace.md)** property of ** [Explorer.CurrentFolder](75e7f120-28df-0c3b-ec05-bd880621141b.md)**) and all stores that have been selected for search in the Search Options dialog box. If  _SearchAllItems_ is False, the method will search only the folder represented by **Explorer.CurrentFolder**.|Since the  ** ** [Search](226a5d49-3caf-90dd-725c-265404d1939f.md)**** object is returned from a prior **Application.AdvancedSearch** operation, the scope of the search associated with **Search.GetTable** is that of the prior **Application.AdvancedSearch**.|
| **Search Filter**|In DAV Searching and Locating (DASL) syntax.|Any valid keywords that are supported by Outlook search in the user interface. Search phrases are delimited by double quotes and can be concatenated to form a single search filter string.|Similar to the scope, the filter is of the search associated with  **Search.GetTable** is the filter parameter of the prior **Application.AdvancedSearch**.|
| **Search Completion**|Use the  ** [AdvancedSearchComplete](4f33ad44-20a3-62cd-aa1b-db74581ebb3c.md)** event to determine when a given search has completed.|Does not provide a callback to indicate search completion.|Search is completed in the prior  **Application.AdvancedSearch**.  **Search.GetTable** only returns the search results.|
| **Search Results**|Access the search results by one of these means: 
<ul xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p><b><a href="405166fa-d0bc-33d2-f4aa-908fb821edd6.htm">Search.Results</a></b> contains the search results as a <b><a href="59057f6f-8f6d-eed0-c945-240b9593b7ea.htm">Results</a></b> collection. Each item in the collection contain the full set of item properties.</p></li><li><p>Search.Save saves the results to a search folder. </p></li><li><p><b><a href="3aba6b77-73a3-9620-9c18-b2e03c7b63bc.htm">Search.GetTable</a></b> also returns the same set of items as in the <b>Results</b> collection, but each item  will contain only a default set of properties and therefore generally offers better performance.</p></li></ul>|Search results are displayed in the Explorer for the current folder. To remove any search results in the Explorer, call  ** [Explorer.ClearSearch](644b6012-0b87-b4cb-6104-6f05b5c4dcc5.md)**.|Search results are returned in a  **Table** which includes the same set of items returned from the prior **Application.AdvancedSearch**. Since the  **Table** only includes a limited set of properties per item, this is generally a more efficient way to access search results. To include properties other than the default in the search results, use ** [Columns.Add](d438cfeb-629f-4234-6f4f-ffa086ef9a41.md)** to get an updated **Table**. Since the item's Entry ID is one of the returned properties, you can also use  ** [GetItemFromID](f2abff80-4c04-998b-654b-28600424a16f.md)** to obtain the item object, and access other item properties like **Body** and **AutoResolvedWinner** that are not supported by the **Table** object for performance reasons.|
