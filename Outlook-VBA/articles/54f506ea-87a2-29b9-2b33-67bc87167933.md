Occurs whenever an Microsoft Outlook item is sent, either by the user through an  ** [Inspector](d7384756-669c-0549-1032-c3b864187994.md)**(before the inspector is closed, but after the user clicks the  **Send** button) or when the ** [Send](78c85013-523e-447b-c47d-2da0705f1fe0.md)**method for an Outlook item, such as  ** [MailItem](14197346-05d2-0250-fa4c-4a6b07daf25f.md)**, is used in a program. 


## Syntax

## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example shows how to cancel the  **ItemSend**event in response to user input. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Outlook.


```
Public WithEvents myOlApp As Outlook.Application 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlApp = Outlook.Application 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlApp_ItemSend(ByVal Item As Object, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Dim prompt As String 
 
 prompt = "Are you sure you want to send " &amp; Item.Subject &amp; "?" 
 
 If MsgBox(prompt, vbYesNo + vbQuestion, "Sample") = vbNo Then 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
