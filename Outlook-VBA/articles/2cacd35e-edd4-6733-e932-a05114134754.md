# Tab.Index Property (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets an  **Integer** that specifies the position of a ** [Tab](b5571953-0e47-a994-3e82-4e439a77afa8.md)** object within a ** [Tabs](0b209e50-60c7-e991-f0fb-627dd17cb7ec.md)** collection. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Index**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Tab** object.


## Remarks

The  **Index** property specifies the order in which tabs appear. Changing the value of **Index** visually changes the order of tabs on a ** [TabStrip](643c896a-2304-42f3-f5e9-0feee6d22364.md)**. The index value for the first tab is zero, the index value of the second tab is one, and so on.

In a  **MultiPage**,  **Index** refers to a **Page** as well as the page's **Tab**. In a  **TabStrip**,  **Index** refers to the tab only.
