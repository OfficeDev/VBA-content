# Image Object (Outlook Forms Script)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Displays a picture on a form.

## Remarks

The  **Image** control lets you display a picture as part of the data in a form. For example, you might use an **Image** to display employee photographs in a personnel form.

The  **Image** lets you crop, size, or zoom a picture, but does not allow you to edit the contents of the picture. For example, you cannot use the **Image** to change the colors in the picture, to make the picture transparent, or to refine the image of the picture. You must use image editing software for these purposes.

The  **Image** supports the following file formats:


- *.bmp
    
- *.cur
    
- *.gif
    
- *.ico
    
- *.jpg
    
- *.wmf
    


You can also display a picture on a  ** [Label](546cc9e1-90e9-3b29-88ac-02fcc75f8f29.md)**. However, a  **Label** does not let you crop, size, or zoom the picture.<P>
