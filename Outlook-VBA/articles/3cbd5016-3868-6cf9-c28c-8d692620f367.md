# OlkComboBox.SelLength Property (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Long** that specifies the number of characters in the current selection. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelLength**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **OlkComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The current selection is specified by  ** [SelText](595b3e85-7d30-72bc-c1d4-b45c4492c221.md)**, which is a portion of the control's  ** [Value](742dd2a3-d3ef-46f9-4aca-5ebe8af17356.md)**. The maximum number of characters that can be supported for  **Value** is ** [MaxLength](87248b73-a6c5-0cc1-a711-13922195f406.md)**.

The default value is zero, which means no text is currently selected.

The  **SelLength** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus.

Setting  **SelLength** to a value less than zero causes an error. Attempting to set the value greater than **MaxLength** results in setting **SelLength** to **MaxLength**.
