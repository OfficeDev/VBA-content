# Reminder Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an Outlook reminder.

## Remarks

Reminders allow users to keep track of upcoming appointments by scheduling a pop-up dialog box to appear at a given time. In addition to appointments, reminders can occur for tasks, contacts and e-mail messages.

Use  ** [Reminders](1f5428f0-6362-a691-2fad-c80e48dce3f5.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the name or index number of the reminder, to return a single **Reminder** object.

Reminders are created programmatically when a new Microsoft Outlook item, such as an  ** [AppointmentItem](204a409d-654e-27aa-643a-8344c631b82d.md)** object, is created and the item 's ** [ReminderSet](575d5fb2-1672-ddae-832c-7dcc7d1da2d6.md)** property is set to **True**.

Use the  **Reminders** collection's ** [Remove](c7a25177-8869-39c2-4109-5c2e2a4bd193.md)** method to remove a **Reminder** object from the collection. Once a reminder is removed from its associated item, the **AppointmentItem** object's **ReminderSet** property is set to **False**.


## Example

The following example displays the caption of the first reminder in the collection.


```
Sub ViewReminderInfo() 
 
 'Displays information about first reminder in collection 
 
 
 
 Dim colReminders As Outlook.Reminders 
 
 Dim objRem As Reminder 
 
 
 
 Set colReminders = Application.Reminders 
 
 'If there are reminders, display message 
 
 If colReminders.Count <> 0 Then 
 
 Set objRem = colReminders.Item(1) 
 
 MsgBox "The caption of the first reminder in the collection is: " &amp; _ 
 
 objRem.Caption 
 
 Else 
 
 MsgBox "There are no reminders in the collection." 
 
 
 
 End If 
 
 
 
End Sub
```

The following example creates a new appointment item and sets the  **ReminderSet** property to **True**, adding a new  **Reminder** object to the **Reminders** collection.




```
Sub AddAppt() 
 
 'Adds a new appointment and reminder to the reminders collection 
 
 Dim objApt As AppointmentItem 
 
 
 
 Set objApt = Application.CreateItem(olAppointmentItem) 
 
 objApt.ReminderSet = True 
 
 objApt.Subject = "Tuesday's meeting" 
 
 objApt.Save 
 
End Sub
```
