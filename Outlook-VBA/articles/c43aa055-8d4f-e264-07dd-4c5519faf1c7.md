# SenderInAddressListRuleCondition Object (Outlook)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a rule condition that the sender's address is in the address list specified in  ** [AddressRuleCondition.Address](de4186ec-0741-8ff6-7789-af0a46c470e0.md)**.

## Remarks

 **SenderInAddressListRuleCondition** is derived from the ** [RuleCondition](e03f91c2-2c08-b036-104a-d6246f28bc2d.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a ** [RuleConditions](e8e9a05a-b36b-add2-b294-8cdc5a97e119.md)** object which has a ** [SenderInAddressList](bf836af6-fd72-d77d-dfbe-90a8038188a6.md)** property. The **SenderInAddressList** property always returns a **SenderInAddressListRuleCondition** object. If the rule has any of these rule conditions enabled, then ** [SenderInAddressListRuleCondition.Enabled](8c3f9e08-d803-9f19-9607-61c6f4ac1418.md)** would be **True**.

For more information on specifying rule conditions, see  [Specify Rule Conditions](812c131a-fe23-1b8b-5e2d-9459d7102630.md).
