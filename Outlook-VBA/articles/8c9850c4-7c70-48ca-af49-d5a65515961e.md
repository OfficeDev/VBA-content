When you design a form, use the grid to align controls easily and precisely.


1. In the Forms Designer, on the  **Developer** tab, in the **Arrange** group, click **Align**, and then click  **Set Grid Size**. 
    
     **Note**  When you customize forms with form regions, the grid is not displayed by default. For more information, see  [How to: Hide or Show the Grid](63140c68-35ae-a8a5-b678-9b886718722b.md).
2. In the  **Height** and **Width** boxes, type the dimensions for the grid.
    
     **Tip**  If you set the grid size to position command buttons in your application, use small grid settings so that you can position the command buttons closer to the edge of the form.
