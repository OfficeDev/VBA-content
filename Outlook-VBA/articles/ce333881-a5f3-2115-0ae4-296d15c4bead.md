 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

## Syntax

 _expression_. **IsConversationEnabled**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Store](1eb22fe9-8849-7476-5388-2515b48591b9.md)** object.


## Remarks

 A store supports Conversation view if the store is a POP, IMAP, or PST store, or if it runs a version of Microsoft Exchange Server that is at least Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. A store also supports Conversation view if the store is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, the version of Outlook is at least Outlook, and Outlook is running in cached mode.

If a store supports conversations, calling the  **GetConversation** method of an item in the store returns a ** [Conversation](2705d38a-ebc0-e5a7-208b-ffe1f5446b1b.md)** object for the item. If the store does not support conversations, **GetConversation** returns **Null** ( **Nothing** in Visual Basic) for items in the store.
