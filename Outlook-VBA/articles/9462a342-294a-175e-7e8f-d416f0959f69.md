Saves the  ** [StorageItem](41776bc3-b838-2755-fd6b-3b5012fb9ae5.md)**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Save**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **StorageItem** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the  **StorageItem** has never been saved before, **Save** saves the item as a hidden item in the ** [Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** on which ** [Folder.GetStorage](cc5ee63b-7d11-6340-8392-8b35a689a28c.md)** was called. If the **StorageItem** has been saved previously and the item has since been changed, **Save** saves the changes to the item. If the **StorageItem** has been saved previously and the item has not been changed since then, the **Save** method does nothing.

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code sample in Visual Basic for Applications shows how to use the  **StorageItem** object to store private solution data. It saves the data in a custom property of a **StorageItem** object in the Inbox folder. The following describes the steps:


1. The code sample calls  ** [Folder.GetStorage](cc5ee63b-7d11-6340-8392-8b35a689a28c.md)** to obtain an existing **StorageItem** object that has the subject "My Private Storage" in the Inbox; if no **StorageItem** with that subject already exists, **GetStorage** creates a **StorageItem** object with that subject.
    
2. If the  **StorageItem** is newly created, the code sample creates a custom property "Order Number" for the object. Note that "Order Number" is a property of a hidden item in the Inbox.
    
3. The code sample then assigns a value to "Order Number" and saves the  **StorageItem** object.
    





```
Sub AssignStorageData() 
 
 Dim oInbox As Outlook.Folder 
 
 Dim myStorage As Outlook.StorageItem 
 
 
 
 Set oInbox = Application.Session.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox) 
 
 ' Get an existing instance of StorageItem, or create new if it doesn't exist 
 
 Set myStorage = oInbox.GetStorage("My Private Storage", olIdentifyBySubject) 
 
 ' If StorageItem is new, add a custom property for Order Number 
 
 If myStorage.Size = 0 Then 
 
 myStorage.UserProperties.Add "Order Number", olNumber 
 
 End If 
 
 ' Assign a value to the custom property 
 
 myStorage.UserProperties("Order Number").Value = 100 
 
 myStorage.Save 
 
End Sub 
 

```
