 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Unload**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [RemoteItem](6302aaff-cdcf-4d86-60f1-4bed15540d9f.md)** object.


## Remarks

This event occurs after the  **Close** event for the Outlook item occurs, but before the Outlook item is unloaded from memory, allowing an add-in to release any resources related to the object. Although the event occurs before the Outlook item is unloaded from memory, this event cannot be canceled.


 **Note**  This event is meant only as a notification event, so that an add-in can dereference the object. An error occurs if any property or method for this object is called within the  **Unload** event.
