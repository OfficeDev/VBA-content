 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A control that supports a single or multiple-line data entry.

## Remarks

Before you use this control for the first time in the forms designer, add the Microsoft Outlook Text Box Control to the control toolbox. You can only add this control to a form region in an Outlook form using the forms designer.

The following is an example of a text box control that has been bound to the Organizer field. This control supports Microsoft Windows themes.
