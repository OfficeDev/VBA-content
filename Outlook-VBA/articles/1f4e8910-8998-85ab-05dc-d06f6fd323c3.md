It uses the  **ExchangeUser** object to obtain specific Exchange user information such as the user's Exchange account alias, details about the user's manager, and the distribution lists that the user's manager has joined.


```
Sub ShowManagerDistLists() 
 
 Dim oAE As Outlook.AddressEntry 
 
 Dim oExUser As Outlook.ExchangeUser 
 
 Dim oDistListEntries As Outlook.AddressEntries 
 
 
 
 'Obtain the AddressEntry for CurrentUser 
 
 Set oExUser = _ 
 
 Application.Session.CurrentUser.AddressEntry.GetExchangeUser 
 
 
 
 'Obtain distribution lists that the user's manager has joined 
 
 Set oDistListEntries = oExUser.GetExchangeUserManager.GetMemberOfList 
 
 For Each oAE In oDistListEntries 
 
 If oAE.AddressEntryUserType = _ 
 
 olExchangeDistributionListAddressEntry Then 
 
 Debug.Print (oAE.name) 
 
 End If
