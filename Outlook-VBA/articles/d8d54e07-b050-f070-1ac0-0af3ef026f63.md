## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SaveOption**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **BusinessCardView** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The value of the  **SaveOption** property is set when the ** [BusinessCardView](83706cf8-080c-fbf0-9381-5801a2dd4dfd.md)** object is created by using the ** [Add](8005ca2e-8b28-1286-74d1-448f2a168c65.md)** method of the ** [Views](5dd7edc2-12a2-f4c2-d158-8053d80e8dc9.md)** collection.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example locks the user interface for all views that are available to all users. The subroutine  `LockView` accepts the ** [View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)** object and a **Boolean** value that indicates if the **View** user interface will be locked. In this example the procedure is always called with the **Boolean** value set to **True**.


```
Sub LockPublicViews() 
 
 
 
 Dim objName As NameSpace 
 
 Dim objViews As Views 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 ' Get the Views collection for the Contacts default folder. 
 
 Set objName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set objViews = objName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderContacts).Views 
 
 
 
 ' Enumerate the Views collection and lock the user 
 
 ' interface for any view that can be accessed by 
 
 ' all users who have access to the Notes default folder. 
 
 For Each objView In objViews 
 
 If objView.SaveOption = olViewSaveOptionThisFolderEveryone Then 
 
 Call LockView(objView, True) 
 
 End If 
 
 Next objView 
 
 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub LockView(ByRef objView As View, ByVal blnAns As Boolean) 
 
 
 
 ' Examine the view object. 
 
 With objView 
 
 If blnAns = True Then 
 
 ' Lock the user interface and 
 
 ' save the view 
 
 .LockUserChanges = True 
 
 .Save 
 
 Else 
 
 ' Unlock the user interface of the view. 
 
 .LockUserChanges = False 
 
 End If 
 
 End With 
 
 
 
End Sub
