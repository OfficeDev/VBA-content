# Application.ProtectedViewWindowBeforeClose Event (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Occurs immediately before a protected view window or a document in a protected view window closes.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ProtectedViewWindowBeforeClose**( **_PvWindow_**,  **_CloseReason_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns an  ** [Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PvWindow|Required| **ProtectedViewWindow**|The protected view window that is closed.|
|CloseReason|Required| **[INT]**|A constant in the  [WdProtectedViewCloseReason](54c42790-bc04-2bd5-cd17-fed90a65678f.md) enumeration that specifies the reason the protected view window is closed.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the window does not close when the procedure is finished.
 **Note**  If the  **ProtectedViewWindowsBeforeClose** event is called as part of the [ProtectedView.Edit](8bd4c5cd-8c7a-6bc7-349a-f5ea3d66d921.md) method, setting _Cancel_ to **True** produces no action.

## Example

The following code example prompts the user for a yes or no response before closing any document. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work. For more information about how to do this, see  [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).

The following code example assumes that you have declared an application variable called "App" in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Word Application object.




```
Private Sub App_ProtectedViewWindowBeforeClose(ByVal PvWindow As ProtectedViewWindow, ByVal CloseReason As Long, Cancel As Boolean) 
Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
    intResponse = MsgBox("Do you really " _ 
        &amp; "want to close the document?", _ 
        vbYesNo) 
 
    If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
 
End Sub
```
