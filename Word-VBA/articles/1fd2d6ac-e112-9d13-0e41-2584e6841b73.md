# Dictionary.Path Property (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns the path to the specified dictionary. Read-only  **String**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Path**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Dictionary](1946d60c-2abd-9ca9-8d0b-7068e9173bb3.md)** object.


## Remarks

The path doesn't include a trailing character â€” for example, "C:\MSOffice" or "http://MyServer". Use the  **PathSeparator**property to add the character that separates folders and drive letters. Use the  **Name**property to return the file name without the path and use the  **FullName**property to return the file name and the path together.


 **Note**  You can use the  **PathSeparator** property to build Web addresses even though they contain forward slashes (/) and the **PathSeparator** property defaults to a backslash (\).
