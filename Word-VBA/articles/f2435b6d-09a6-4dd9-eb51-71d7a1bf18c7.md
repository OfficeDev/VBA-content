## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Offset**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[TickLabels](d94e90dc-0b0e-f4af-078e-6f2b97729db5.md)** object.

```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart.Axes(xlCategory).TickLabels 
 If .Offset < 500 then 
 .Offset = .Offset * 2 
 End If 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```
