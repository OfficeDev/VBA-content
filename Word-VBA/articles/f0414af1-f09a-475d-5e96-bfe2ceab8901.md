# ShapeRange.HeightRelative Property (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the percentage of the target shape to which the range of shapes is sized. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **HeightRelative**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the  ** [RelativeVerticalSize](d0842799-9597-fae2-dd54-dfc404c14f59.md)** property. When set to **wdShapeSizeRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the ** [WdShapeSizeRelative](a341aab8-370c-6d29-d640-f8c029a017f1.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent sizing. The height is solely determined by the ** [Height](a11515c7-19d1-b113-cce9-b8c94c6ccbc7.md)** property.
