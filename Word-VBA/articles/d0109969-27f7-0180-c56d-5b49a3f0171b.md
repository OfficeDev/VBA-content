# MailMessage Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the active e-mail message if you are using Microsoft Word as your e-mail editor.

## Remarks

Use the  **MailMessage** property to return the **MailMessage** object. The following example validates the e-mail addresses that appear in the active e-mail message.


```
Application.MailMessage.CheckName
```

The methods of the  **MailMessage** object require that you are using Word as your e-mail editor and that an e-mail message is active. If either of these conditions is not true, an error occurs.
