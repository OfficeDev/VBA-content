## Example

This example applies bold formatting to the new selection. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see  [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_WindowSelectionChange _ 
 (ByVal Sel As Selection) 
 Sel.Font.Bold = True 
End Sub
```
