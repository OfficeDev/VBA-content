 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Occurs immediately before editing is enabled on the document in the specified protected view window.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ProtectedViewWindowBeforeEdit**( **_PvWindow_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns an  ** [Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PvWindow|Required| ** [ProtectedViewWindow](d77e80e7-c54e-5954-1586-dacd3c9f7434.md)**|The protected view window that contains the document that is enabled for editing.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, editing is not enabled on the document.|

## Example

The following code example prompts the user for a yes or no response before enabling editing on a document in a protected view window. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized for this code example to work correctly. For more information about how to do this, see  [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).

The following code example assumes that you have declared an application variable called "App" in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Word Application object.




```
Private Sub App_ProtectedViewWindowBeforeEdit(ByVal PvWindow As ProtectedViewWindow, Cancel As Boolean) 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Do you really " _ 
 &amp; "want to edit the document?", _ 
 vbYesNo) 
 
 If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub 

```
