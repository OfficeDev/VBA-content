 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  ** [WdLanguageID](9b3ef147-95f3-0eb6-db0c-0166fe7d2da2.md)** constant that represents the language for the specified object. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_**LanguageID**

 _expression_Required. An expression that returns a  ** [Dictionary](1946d60c-2abd-9ca9-8d0b-7068e9173bb3.md)** object.


## Remarks

For a custom dictionary, you must first set the  ** [LanguageSpecific](479eefb9-bd50-298b-635d-945ee7848600.md)** property to **True** before specifying the **LanguageID** property. Custom dictionaries that are language-specific check only text that is formatted for that language.

Some  **WdLanguageID** constants may not be available to you, depending on the language support (U.S. English, for example) that you have selected or installed.
