 .DistanceFromRight = 3 
End With

This example adds a single border around each page in section one in the active document. The example also sets the distance between the right and left border and the corresponding edges of the page to 22 points.

Dim borderLoop As Border 
 
With ActiveDocument.Sections(1) 
 For Each borderLoop In .Borders
