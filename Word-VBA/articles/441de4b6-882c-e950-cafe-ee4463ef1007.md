|MatchCase|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to specify that the text to find should be case-sensitive. Corresponds to the **Match case** check box in the **Find and Replace** dialog box (on the **Home** tab in the **Editing** group).|
|MatchWholeWord|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to find only entire words, not text that is part of a larger word. Corresponds to the **Find whole words only** check box in the **Find and Replace** dialog box.|

|MatchPrefix|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to find words that begin with the search string. Corresponds to the **Match prefix** check box in the **Find and Replace** dialog box.|
|MatchSuffix|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to find words that end with the search string. Corresponds to the **Match suffix** check box in the **Find and Replace** dialog box.|
|MatchPhrase|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to ignore all white space and control characters between words.|

A  **Boolean** value that indicates whether the find operation was successful.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If MatchWildcards is  **True**, you can specify wildcard characters and other advanced search criteria for the FindText argument. For example, "*(ing)" finds any word that ends in "ing".

To search for a symbol character, type a caret (^), a zero (0), and then the symbol's character code. For example, "^0151" corresponds to an em dash (â€”).

Unless otherwise specified, replacement text inherits the formatting of the text it replaces in the document. For example, if you replace the string "abc" with "xyz", occurrences of "abc" with bold formatting are replaced with the string "xyz" with bold formatting.

Also, if MatchCase is  **False**, occurrences of the search text that are uppercase will be replaced with an uppercase version of the replacement text, regardless of the case of the replacement text. Using the previous example, occurrences of "ABC" are replaced with "XYZ".


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example finds and selects the next occurrence of the word "library".


```
With Selection.Find 
 .ClearFormatting 
 .MatchWholeWord = True 
 .MatchCase = False 
 .Execute2007 FindText:="library" 
End With
```

The following example finds all occurrences of the word "hi" in the active document and replaces each occurrence with "hello".




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Content 
myRange.Find.Execute2007 FindText:="hi", _ 
 ReplaceWith:="hello", Replace:=wdReplaceAll
```
