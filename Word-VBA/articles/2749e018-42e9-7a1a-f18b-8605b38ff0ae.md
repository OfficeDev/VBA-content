# EmailAuthor Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the author of an e-mail message.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [CurrentEmailAuthor](a317b265-f712-2954-aeaf-3a17da38d380.md)**property to return the  **EmailAuthor** object. The **EmailAuthor** object and its properties are valid only if the active document is an unsent forward, reply, or new e-mail message.

This example returns the style associated with the current author for unsent replies, forwards, or new e-mail messages, and displays the name of the font associated with this style.




```
Set MyEmailStyle = _ 
 ActiveDocument.Email.CurrentEmailAuthor.Style 
Msgbox MyEmailStyle.Font.Name
```


 **Note**  There is no EmailAuthors collection; each  **Email**object contains only one  **EmailAuthor** object.
