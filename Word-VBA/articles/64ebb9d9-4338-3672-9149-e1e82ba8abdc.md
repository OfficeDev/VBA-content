 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, in degrees. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RotationY**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [ThreeDFormat](d397e780-a53d-0cc3-7a02-b40397253e91.md)**object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **RotationY** property can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates rotation to the left; a negative value indicates rotation to the right.

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis, use the  ** [RotationX](8ed5e2de-8a1b-e75e-da7d-10b6d1d1a988.md)**property of the ThreeDFormat object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the  ** [Rotation](7a66bdd7-ffda-64f2-8228-c1bce6d0640b.md)**property of the  ** [Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)**object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the  ** [SetExtrusionDirection](651b2b17-d87b-0007-3722-dc330f3e1f2e.md)**method.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to myDocument and sets their rotation around the y-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```
Set myDocument = ActiveDocument 
With myDocument.Shapes 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 30, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 70, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 110, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 30 
 End With 
End With
```
