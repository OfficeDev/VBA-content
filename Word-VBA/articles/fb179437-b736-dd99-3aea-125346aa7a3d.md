# BuildingBlockTypes Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a collection of  ** [BuildingBlockType](e4f971da-f052-b6a2-db40-2f4cd0cfd6be.md)** objects.

## Remarks

Building block types are represented by  ** [WdBuildingBlockTypes](be7fcedb-04fd-f27d-8f36-3120ca263f06.md)** constants. Use the ** [Item](bb9c6d75-2ea0-da96-8207-dbce2b737161.md)** method to access a specific type in the **BuildingBlockTypes** collection.

To loop through the different building block types, use a  **For** loop with the ** [Count](72fdde8a-94e0-5228-e3d7-4faffdcbc55b.md)** property. The following example loops through the building block types and prints the name in the **Immediate Window**. (This example assumes that the  **Immediate Window** is visible.)




```
Dim objTemplate As Template 
Dim intCount As Integer 
Dim objBBT As BuildingBlockType 
 
Set objTemplate = Templates(1) 
 
For intCount = 1 To objTemplate.BuildingBlockTypes.Count 
 Set objBBT = objTemplate.BuildingBlockTypes(intCount) 
 Debug.Print objBBT.Name 
Next
```
