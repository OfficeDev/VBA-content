Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the horizontal position, measured in points, of the specified range of shapes. Can also be any valid ** [WdShapePosition](6506f482-1a86-855e-66ef-e81ef9f52bc7.md)** constant. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Left**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The position of a shape is measured from the upper-left corner of the shape's bounding box to the shape's anchor. The  **RelativeHorizontalPosition** property controls whether the anchor is positioned alongside a character, column, margin, or the edge of the page.

For a  **ShapeRange** object that contains more than one shape, the **Left** property sets the horizontal position of each shape.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the horizontal position of the first and second shapes in the active document to 1 inch from the left edge of the column.


```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes.Range(Array(1, 2)) 
 .RelativeHorizontalPosition = _ 
 wdRelativeHorizontalPositionColumn 
 .Left = InchesToPoints(1) 
End With
```
