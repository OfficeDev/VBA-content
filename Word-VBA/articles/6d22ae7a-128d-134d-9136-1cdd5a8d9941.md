# Characters Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of characters in a selection, range, or document. There is no Character object; instead, each item in the  **Characters** collection is a ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object that represents one character.

## Remarks

Use the  **Characters** property of a ** [Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)**,  **Range**, or  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object to return the **Characters** collection. The following example displays how many characters are selected.


```
MsgBox Selection.Characters.Count &amp; " characters are selected"
```

Use  **Characters**(Index), where Index is the index number, to return a  **Range** object that represents one character. The index number represents the position of a character in the **Characters** collection. The following example formats the first letter in the selection as 24-point bold.




```
With Selection.Characters(1) 
 .Bold = True 
 .Font.Size = 24 
End With
```

Remarks

The  **Count** property for this collection in a document returns the number of items in the main story only. To count items in other stories use the collection with the **Range** object.

There is no  **Add** method for the **Characters** collection. Instead, use the **InsertAfter**or  **InsertBefore**method to add characters to a  **Range** object. The following example inserts a new paragraph after the first paragraph in the active document.




```
With ActiveDocument 
 .Paragraphs(1).Range.InsertParagraphAfter 
 .Paragraphs(2).Range.InsertBefore "New Text" 
End With
```
