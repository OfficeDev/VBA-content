To take advantage of the collaboration features built into Word, documents must be stored on a Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server.


## Example

This example verifies that a document is not checked out by another user and that it can be checked out. If the document can be checked out, it copies the document to the local computer for editing.


```vb
Sub CheckInOut(docCheckOut As String) 
 If Documents.CanCheckOut(docCheckOut) = True Then 
 Documents.CheckOut docCheckOut 
 Else 
 MsgBox "You are unable to check out this document at this time." 
 End If 
End Sub
```

To call the CheckInOut subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the "http://servername/workspace/report.doc" file name with an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```vb
Sub CheckDocInOut() 
 Call CheckInOut (docCheckIn:="http://servername/workspace/report.doc") 
End Sub
```
