# PlotArea Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the plot area of a chart.

## Remarks

 This is the area where your chart data is plotted. The plot area on a 2-D chart contains the data markers, gridlines, data labels, trendlines, and optional chart items placed in the chart area. The plot area on a 3-D chart contains all the above items plus the walls, floor, axes, axis titles, and tick-mark labels in the chart.

The plot area is surrounded by the chart area. The chart area on a 2-D chart contains the axes, the chart title, the axis titles, and the legend. The chart area on a 3-D chart contains the chart title and the legend. For information about formatting the chart area, see the  ** [ChartArea](7b3384df-f331-033d-4dfa-ee2ff26111c6.md)** object.


## Example

Use the  ** [PlotArea](440f7d57-c681-098e-45d6-a2f7aca6de07.md)** property to return a **PlotArea** object. The following example places a dashed border around the chart area of the first chart in the active document, and then places a dotted border around the plot area.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart 
 .ChartArea.Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
 .PlotArea.Border.LineStyle = xlDot 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```
