 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Word 2013_

To refer to the active paragraph, table, field, or other document element, use the  ** [Selection](d2362378-06a1-3a1a-2bd0-358f190eb6f3.md)**property to return a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)**object. From the  **Selection** object, you can access all paragraphs in the selection or the first paragraph in the selection. The following example applies a border around the first paragraph in the selection.




```
Sub BorderAroundFirstParagraph() 
 Selection.Paragraphs(1).Borders.Enable = True 
End Sub
```

The following example applies a border around each paragraph in the selection.



```
Sub BorderAroundSelection() 
 Selection.Paragraphs.Borders.Enable = True 
End Sub
```

The following example applies shading to the first row of the first table in the selection.



```
Sub ShadeTableRow() 
 Selection.Tables(1).Rows(1).Shading.Texture = wdTexture10Percent 
End Sub
```

An error occurs if the selection doesn't include a table. Use the  ** [Count](c2ee44d9-6ab7-e94b-a132-b752f9f7b669.md)**property to determine if the selection includes a table. The following example applies shading to the first row of the first table in the selection.



```
Sub ShadeTableRow() 
 If Selection.Tables.Count >= 1 Then 
 Selection.Tables(1).Rows(1).Shading.Texture = wdTexture25Percent 
 Else 
 MsgBox "Selection doesn't include a table" 
 End If 
End Sub
```

The following example applies shading to the first row of every table in the selection. The  **For Each...Next** loop is used to step through the individual tables in the selection.



```
Sub ShadeAllFirstRowsInTables() 
 Dim tblTable As Table 
 If Selection.Tables.Count >= 1 Then 
 For Each tblTable In Selection.Tables 
 tblTable.Rows(1).Shading.Texture = wdTexture30Percent 
 Next tblTable 
 End If 
End Sub
```
