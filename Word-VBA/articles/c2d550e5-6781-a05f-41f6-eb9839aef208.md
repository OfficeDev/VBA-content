Occurs when the editing area of a document window is right-clicked, before the default right-click action.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

Private Sub  _expression_._**WindowBeforeRightClick**( **_ByVal Sel As Selection_**,  **_Cancel As Boolean_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  ** [Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object that has been declared with events in a class module.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Sel|Required| **Selection**|The current selection.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the default right-click action does not occur when the procedure is finished.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For more information about using events with the  **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example prompts the user for a yes or no response before executing the default right-click action. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see  [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_WindowBeforeRightClick _ 
 (ByVal Sel As Selection, Cancel As Boolean) 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Selection = " &amp; Sel &amp; vbLf &amp; vbLf _ 
 &amp; "Continue with operation on this selection?", _ 
 vbYesNo) 
 If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub
```
