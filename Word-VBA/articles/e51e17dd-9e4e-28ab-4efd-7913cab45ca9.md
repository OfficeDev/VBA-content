 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns the coordinates of the specified freeform drawing's vertices (and control points for BÃ©zier curves) as a series of coordinate pairs. Read-only  **Variant**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Vertices**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use the array returned by this property as an argument for the  **AddCurve** or **AddPolyLine** method.

The following table shows how the  **Vertices** property associates values in the array _vertArray()_ with the coordinates of a triangle's vertices.



|**vertArray element**|**Contains**|
|:-----|:-----|
| `vertArray(1, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the first vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(1, 2)`|The vertical distance from the first vertex to the top of the document.|
|vertArray(2, 1)|The horizontal distance from the second vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(2, 2)`|The vertical distance from the second vertex to the top of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the third vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 2)`|The vertical distance from the third vertex to the top of the document.|

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example assigns the vertex coordinates for shape one in the active document to an array variable and displays the coordinates for the first vertex. Shape one must be a freeform drawing.


```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(1) 
    vertArray = .Vertices 
    x1 = vertArray(1, 1) 
    y1 = vertArray(1, 2) 
    MsgBox "First vertex coordinates: " &amp; x1 &amp; ", " &amp; y1 
End With
```

This example creates a curve that has the same geometric description as shape one in the active document. This example assumes that the first shape is a BÃ©zier curve containing 3n+1 vertices, where n is the number of curve segments.




```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes 
    .AddCurve .Item(1).Vertices, Selection.Range 
End With
```
