# Change a Content Control from One Type to Another

 _**Applies to:** Word 2013_

The content controls that you can create in documents in Word 2007 and later are extremely flexible. In most cases, you can easily switch a content control from one type to another. For example, if you have a date content control, you can change it to be a text content control, or if you have a text content control, you can change it to be a rich-text content control. To do this, you use the  ** [Type](24f4099d-b4ad-c7be-60a4-e23ede378208.md)** property and set it to a ** [WdContentControlType](6bf57b23-d12f-b942-4a30-cd1deed09407.md)** constant.


 **Note**  Depending on the contents of a content control, you may not be able to change the content control type. For example, if you have a rich-text content control that contains formatted text, you may not be able to change the control to be a plain-text content control. In this case, Word raises a run-time error. 

The objects used in this sample are:

-  [ContentControl](783dec26-9b63-11f8-6187-985f9c815f27.md)
    
-  [ContentControls](2595eea9-df68-edce-3a51-069cad14bb87.md)
    
-  [ContentControlListEntries](74b90054-e0a3-37c5-40d2-dc6dd6389cc5.md)
    
The following example inserts a new date content control that contains the current date and then changes it to be a text content control.



```
Sub ChangeTypeOfControl() 
 Dim objCC As ContentControl 
 Dim strDate As Date 
 
 strDate = Date 
 Set objCC = Selection.ContentControls.Add(wdContentControlDate) 
 objCC.Range.Text = strDate 
 
 objCC.Type = wdContentControlText 
End Sub
```

The following example inserts a drop-down list content control and then changes it to be a rich-text content control.



```
Sub ChangeContentControlType() 
 Dim objCC As ContentControl 
 
 Set objCC = ActiveDocument.ContentControls.Add(Type:=wdContentControlDropdownList) 
 objCC.SetPlaceholderText Text:="My Favorite Animal" 
 
 'List entries 
 objCC.DropdownListEntries.Add "Cat" 
 objCC.DropdownListEntries.Add "Dog" 
 objCC.DropdownListEntries.Add "Horse" 
 objCC.DropdownListEntries.Add "Monkey" 
 objCC.DropdownListEntries.Add "Snake" 
 objCC.DropdownListEntries.Add "Other" 
 
 Stop 
 
 ' Switch to view the new content control in the active document. 
 ' Notice that the content control is a drop-down list. 
 
 objCC.Type = wdContentControlRichText 
 
 ' After running the above code, the content control is no longer 
 ' a drop-down; it is a text content control. Only the placeholder 
 ' text remains; Word removes the items in the list. 
End Sub
```
