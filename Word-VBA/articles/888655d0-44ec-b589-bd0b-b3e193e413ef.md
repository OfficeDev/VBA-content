## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **MoveUntil**( **_Cset_**,  **_Count_**)

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cset|Required| **Variant**|One or more characters. If any character in Cset is found before the Count value expires, the specified selection is positioned as an insertion point immediately before that character. This argument is case sensitive.|
|Count|Optional| **Variant**|The maximum number of characters by which the specified selection is to be moved. Can be a number or either the  **wdForward** or **wdBackward** constant. If Count is a positive number, the selection is moved forward in the document, beginning at the end position. If it is a negative number, the selection is moved backward, beginning at the start position. The default value is **wdForward**.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This method returns the number of characters by which the specified selection was moved, as a  **Long** value. If Count is greater than 0 (zero), this method returns the number of characters moved plus one. If Count is less than 0 (zero), this method returns the number of characters moved minus one. If no Cset characters are found, the selection isn't not changed and the method returns 0 (zero).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example moves the selection forward to the end of the active paragraph and then displays the number of characters by which the selection was moved.


```
x = Selection.MoveUntil(Cset:=Chr$(13), Count:=wdForward) 
MsgBox x-1 &amp; " character positions were moved"
```
