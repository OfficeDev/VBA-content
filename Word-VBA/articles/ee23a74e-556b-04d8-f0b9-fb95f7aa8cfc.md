# Email Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an e-mail message.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [Email](dd4f6a41-3ee6-c1bf-3a2c-e00a342e0009.md)**property to return the  **Email** object. The **Email** object and its properties are valid only if the active document is an unsent forward, reply, or new e-mail message.

This example displays the name of the style associated with the current e-mail author.




```
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Email _ 
 .CurrentEmailAuthor.Style.NameLocal
```

The author style name is the same as the value returned by the  ** [UserName](96f5ffb6-a20d-96f0-e3a4-0ad2dd47bf99.md)**property.


 **Note**   There is no Emails collection; each **Document** object contains only one **Email** object.
