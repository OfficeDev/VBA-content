## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Top**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The position of a shape is measured from the upper-left corner of the shape's bounding box to the shape's anchor. The  **RelativeVerticalPosition** property controls whether the shape's anchor is positioned alongside the line, the paragraph, the margin, or the edge of the page.

For a  **ShapeRange** object that contains more than one shape, the **Top** property sets the vertical position of each shape.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the vertical position of the first shape in the active document to 1 inch from the top of the page.


```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(1) 
 .RelativeVerticalPosition = wdRelativeVerticalPositionPage 
 .Top = InchesToPoints(1) 
End With
```
