# Comments Object (Word)

A collection of  **[Comment](0a2841f3-ca3c-8186-afab-f634ebd97d4c.md)** objects that represent the comments in a selection, range, or document.


## Remarks

Use the  **Comments** property to return the **Comments** collection. The following example displays comments made by Don Funk in the active document.


```vb
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.SplitSpecial = wdPaneComments 
ActiveDocument.Comments.ShowBy = "Don Funk"
```

Use the  **[Add](bf3e2f9b-b7d6-f669-c82a-70ff58aaedfe.md)** method to add a comment at the specified range. The following example adds a comment immediately after the selection.




```
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
ActiveDocument.Comments.Add Range:=Selection.Range, _ 
 Text:="review this"
```

Use  **Comments** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **Comment** object. The index number represents the position of the comment in the specified selection, range, or document. The following example displays the author of the first comment in the active document.




```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Comments(1).Author
```

The following example displays the initials of the author of the first comment in the selection.




```vb
If Selection.Comments.Count >= 1 Then MsgBox _ 
 Selection.Comments(1).Initial
```
