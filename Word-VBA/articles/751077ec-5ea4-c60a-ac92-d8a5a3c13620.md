 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


 **True** if all nonprinting characters (such as hidden text, tab marks, space marks, and paragraph marks) are displayed. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ShowAll**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This property only affects the specified range when  **Show Markup** is set to **Show Revisions in Balloons**. When  **Range.ShowAll** is set to **False**,  ** [Range.Text](495fe06e-ba87-0d96-9f6e-3e62fd71d4a5.md)** provides all of the text in the range except deleted text. If you set **Range.ShowAll** to **True**, then  ** [Range.Text](495fe06e-ba87-0d96-9f6e-3e62fd71d4a5.md)** provides all of the text in the range including the text that was deleted.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example displays all the text in the specified range, excluding deleted text.


 **Note**  This example assumes that the active document has change tracking enabled, that  **Show Markup** is set to **Show Revisions in Balloons**, and that some text has been deleted from the document.


```
Sub HideDeletedText()
Dim r As Range

Set r = ActiveDocument.Range
r.ShowAll = False
Debug.Print r.Text

End Sub
```
