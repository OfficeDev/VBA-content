## Remarks

A glyph is a visual representation of a character. Ligatures are two or more glyphs that are represented by what appears to the reader as a single character in order to create more readable or attractive text. Use the  [Font.Ligatures Property (Word)](f1b0ff39-5eb5-e5a3-e0ff-3e88639670f9.md) property to specify the ligatures to apply to a font in Word.


 **Note**  The order of preference when a combination of ligature types are applied differs by font and is not controlled by the Word application.
