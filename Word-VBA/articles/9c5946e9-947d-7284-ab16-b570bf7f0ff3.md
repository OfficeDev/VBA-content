# BuildingBlockEntries Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a collection of all  ** [BuildingBlock](2558b89f-8552-bb71-fa40-101cab2635ba.md)** objects in a template.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [Add](09578906-ea6d-9475-e026-b9dc437f451b.md)** method to create a new building block and add it to a template. The following example adds the selected text to the watermarks building block gallery of the first template in the ** [Templates](de62f768-011a-7446-48c3-1c4512da5f7c.md)** collection.


```
Dim objTemplate As Template 
Dim objBB As BuildingBlock 
 
Set objTemplate = Templates(1) 
 
Set objBB = objTemplate.BuildingBlockEntries _ 
 .Add(Name:="New Building Block Entry", _ 
 Type:=wdTypeWatermarks, _ 
 Category:="General", _ 
 Range:=Selection.Range)
```

Unlike the  **Add** method for the **BuildingBlocks** collection, you need to specify the type and category when you add a building block using the **Add** method of the **BuildingBlockEntries** collection. This is because building blocks are organized by using types and categories. When you use the **BuildingBlockEntries** collection, you are accessing the entire collection of building blocks in a template; however, when you use the **BuildingBlocks** collection, you are accessing the collection of building blocks for a specific type and category in a template.


 **Note**  Using the  **Category** and **Type** properties for the **BuildingBlock** object enables you to determine the category and type for a building block.
