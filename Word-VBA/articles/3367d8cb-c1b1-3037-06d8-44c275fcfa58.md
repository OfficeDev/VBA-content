## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example accepts all of the conflicts in the active document.


```
Dim conf As Conflict 
 
For Each conf In ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Conflicts 
    conf.Accept 
Next conf
```

Alternatively, you can use the  [AcceptAll](8ccb2b0c-77ca-ff27-1e8d-5c1d504d8821.md) method of the [Conflicts](476e8f6d-c93e-b372-2fa7-1c9a4a84a182.md) collection object to accept all the conflicts in a document, as shown in the following code example.




```
ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Conflicts.AcceptAll
```
