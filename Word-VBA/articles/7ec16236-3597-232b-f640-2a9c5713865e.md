 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  ** [WdOMathBreakBin](cd578a4e-6c71-3400-0631-f2b555d4b693.md)** constant that represents where Microsoft Word places binary operators when equations span two or more lines. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **OMathBreakBin**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Document** object.


## Remarks

When the equation breaks on a binary operatorâ€”for example, an addition, subtraction, or multiplication operatorâ€”there are three different placements of the operator: before the break, after the break, and repeated both before and after the break.

When this property is set to  **wdOMathBreakBinRepeat**, use the  ** [OMathBreakSub](a361f255-1392-eddc-7771-98e9db7c291a.md)** property to specify how Word treats subtraction operators that appear before a line break.
