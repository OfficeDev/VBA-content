# FillFormat.TextureName Property (Word)

Returns the name of the custom texture file for the specified fill. Read-only  **String** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **TextureName**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[FillFormat](39205d07-9e37-1be1-ec4a-93ba8bac2f26.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use the  **[UserTextured](4407df38-2660-5974-eadb-e30fe292ef11.md)** method to set the texture file for the fill.


## Example

This example adds an oval to the active document. If the second shape in the document has a user-defined textured fill, the new oval will have the same fill as shape two. If shape two has any other type of fill, the new oval will have a green marble fill. This example assumes that the active document already has at least two shapes.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes 
 Set newFill = .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 0, 0, 200, 90).Fill 
 With .Item(2).Fill 
 If.TextureType = msoTextureUserDefined Then 
 newFill.UserTextured .TextureName 
 Else 
 newFill.PresetTextured msoTextureGreenMarble 
 End If 
 End With 
End With
```
