 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs when the user exits Microsoft Word.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

Private Sub Application_**Quit**()

 _expression_A variable that represents an  ** [Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object that has been declared with events in a class module.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For information about using events with the  **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example ensures that the  **Standard** and **Formatting** toolbars are visible before the user exits Word. As a result, when Word is started again, the **Standard** and **Formatting** toolbars are visible.

This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see  [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.




```
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_Quit() 
 CommandBars("Standard").Visible = True 
 CommandBars("Formatting").Visible = True 
End Sub
```
