## Example

This example creates a new document, adds a rectangle to it that's 100 points wide and 50 points high, and sets the upper-left corner of the rectangle to be 5 points from the left edge and 25 points from the upper-left corner of the page.


```vb
Set myDoc = Documents.Add 
myDoc.Shapes.AddShape msoShapeRectangle, 5, 25, 100, 50
```

This example sets the fill texture for all the shapes in the active document.




```vb
For Each s in ActiveDocument.Shapes 
 s.Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureOak 
Next s
```

This example adds a shadow to the first shape in the active document.




```vb
Set myShape = ActiveDocument.Shapes(1) 
myShape.Shadow.Type = msoShadow6
```
