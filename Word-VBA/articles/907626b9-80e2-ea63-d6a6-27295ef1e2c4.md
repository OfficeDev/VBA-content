# ShapeRange.WidthRelative Property (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the relative width of a range of shapes. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **WidthRelative**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the  ** [RelativeHorizontalSize](ef832943-d587-545f-feb9-f2cbcb0734cc.md)** property. When set to **wdShapeSizeRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the ** [WdShapeSizeRelative](a341aab8-370c-6d29-d640-f8c029a017f1.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent sizing. The width is solely determined by the ** [Width](8925e4f8-d85a-98c8-499e-ae102dced440.md)** property.
