# Shape.WidthRelative Property (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the relative width of a shape. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **WidthRelative**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the  ** [RelativeVerticalSize](3ccbd15e-32ed-4435-6b76-20543dfa6d62.md)** property. When set to **wdShapeSizeRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the ** [WdShapeSizeRelative](a341aab8-370c-6d29-d640-f8c029a017f1.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent sizing. The width is solely determined by the ** [Width](e4271c95-18d0-639a-9047-658259e4f8bb.md)** property.
