# Version Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a single version of a document. The  **Version** object is a member of the **Versions**collection. The  **Versions** collection includes all the versions of the specified document.

## Remarks

Use  **Versions**(Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single  **Version** object. The index number represents the position of the version in the **Versions** collection. The first version added to the **Versions** collection is index number 1. The following example displays the comment, author, and date of the first version of the active document.


```
If ActiveDocument.Versions.Count >= 1 Then 
 With ActiveDocument.Versions(1) 
 MsgBox "Comment = " &amp; .Comment &amp; vbCr &amp; "Author = " &amp; _ 
 .SavedBy &amp; vbCr &amp; "Date = " &amp; .Date 
 End With 
End If
```

Use the  **Save**method to add an item to the  **Versions** collection. The following example adds a version of the active document with the specified comment.




```
ActiveDocument.Versions.Save _ 
 Comment:="incorporated Judy's revisions"
```
