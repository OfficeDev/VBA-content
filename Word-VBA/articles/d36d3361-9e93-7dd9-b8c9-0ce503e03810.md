# Frame Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a frame. The  **Frame** object is a member of the **Frames**collection. The  ** [Frames](d0f526b5-ae1d-ad7a-0da3-5a7b30526b55.md)** collection includes all frames in a selection, range, or document.

## Remarks

Use  **Frames**(Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single  **Frame** object. The index number represents the position of the frame in the selection, range, or document. The following example allows text to wrap around the first frame in the active document.


```
ActiveDocument.Frames(1).TextWrap = True
```

Use the  **Add**method to add a frame around a range. The following example adds a frame around the first paragraph in the active document.




```
ActiveDocument.Frames.Add _ 
 Range:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range
```

You can wrap text around  **Shape** or **ShapeRange** objects by using the **WrapFormat**property. You can position a  **Shape** or **ShapeRange** object by using the **Top**and  **Left**properties.
