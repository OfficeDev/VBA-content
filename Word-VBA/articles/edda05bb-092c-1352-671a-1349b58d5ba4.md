To test your dialog box in the Visual Basic Editor, click  **Run Sub/UserForm** on the **Run** menu.

To display a dialog box from Visual Basic, use the  **Show**method. The following example displays the dialog box named UserForm1.



```
Private Sub GetUserName() 
 UserForm1.Show 
End Sub
```


 **Note**  Use the  **Unload** method in an event procedure, such as the Click event procedure for a command button, to close a dialog box.
