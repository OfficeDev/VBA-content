# EndnoteOptions Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the properties assigned to a range or selection of endnotes in a document.

## Remarks

Use the  **EndnoteOptions** property of the ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** or ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object to return an **EndnoteOptions** object.

Using the  **EndnoteOptions** object, you can assign different endnote properties to different areas of a document. For example, you may want endnotes in the introduction of a long document to be displayed as lowercase Roman numerals, while in the rest of your document they are displayed as Arabic numerals. The following example uses the ** [NumberingRule](c2690da3-703b-4f9f-cdfb-7ec4e7559b54.md)**,  ** [NumberStyle](732a8185-92c3-5054-fb9d-3c4bad62f5a1.md)**, and  ** [StartingNumber](10d8d08b-dac5-5439-1f75-2d485c905e8f.md)** properties to format the endnotes in the first section ofthe active document.




```
Sub BookIntro() 
 Dim rngIntro As Range 
 
 'Sets the range as section one of the active document 
 Set rngIntro = ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Range 
 
 'Formats the EndnoteOptions properties 
 With rngIntro.EndnoteOptions 
 .NumberingRule = wdRestartSection 
 .NumberStyle = wdNoteNumberStyleLowercaseRoman 
 .StartingNumber = 1 
 End With 
End Sub
```
