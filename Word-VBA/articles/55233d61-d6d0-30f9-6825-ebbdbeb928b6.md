# DropDown Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a drop-down form field that contains a list of items in a form.

## Remarks

Use  **FormFields**(index), where index is the index number or the bookmark name associated with the drop-down form field, to return a single  **FormField** object. Use the **DropDown**property with the  **FormField** object to return a **DropDown** object. The following example selects the first item in the drop-down form field named "DropDown" in the active document.


```
ActiveDocument.FormFields("DropDown1").DropDown.Value = 1
```

The index number represents the position of the form field in the  ** [FormFields](a44a0f57-123b-cade-e306-ba6dc179b619.md)**collection. The following example checks the type of the first form field in the active document. If it is a drop-down form field, the second item is selected.




```
If ActiveDocument.FormFields(1).Type = wdFieldFormDropDown Then 
 ActiveDocument.FormFields(1).DropDown.Value = 2 
End If
```

The following example determines whether form field represented by  _ffield_ is a valid drop-down form field before adding an item to it.




```
Set ffield = ActiveDocument.FormFields(1).DropDown 
If ffield.Valid = True Then 
 ffield.ListEntries.Add Name:="Hello" 
Else 
 MsgBox "First field is not a drop down" 
End If
```

Use the  **Add**method with the  **FormFields** collection to add a drop-down form field. The following example adds a drop-down form field at the beginning of the active document and then adds items to the form field.




```
Set ffield = ActiveDocument.FormFields.Add( _ 
 Range:=ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=0), _ 
 Type:=wdFieldFormDropDown) 
With ffield 
 .Name = "Colors" 
 With .DropDown.ListEntries 
 .Add Name:="Blue" 
 .Add Name:="Green" 
 .Add Name:="Red" 
 End With 
End With
```
