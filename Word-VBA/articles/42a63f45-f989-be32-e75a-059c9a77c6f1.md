# EmailSignatureEntries Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  ** [EmailSignatureEntry](a8cf11de-7a46-c609-3cd7-508e9ef91e09.md)** objects that represents all the e-mail signature entries available to Word.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [EmailSignatureEntries](8b5a2f6a-d9fe-5f92-d93d-a59e67ee7100.md)**property to return the  **EmailSignatureEntries** collection. Use the ** [Add](da8b1a9a-aa3f-4288-887f-50d646d75728.md)**method of the  **EmailSignatureEntries** object to add an e-mail signature to Word. The following example creates a new e-mail signature entry based on the author's name and a selection in the active document, and then it sets the new signature entry as the default e-mail signature to use for new messages.


```
Sub NewEmailSignature() 
 With Application.EmailOptions.EmailSignature 
 .EmailSignatureEntries.Add "Jeff Smith", Selection.Range 
 .NewMessageSignature = "Jeff Smith" 
 End With 
End Sub
```
