For more information about using events with the  **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example prompts the user for a yes or no response before printing any document. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see  [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_DocumentBeforePrint _ 
 (ByVal Doc As Document, _ 
 Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Have you checked the " _ 
 &amp; "printer for letterhead?", _ 
 vbYesNo) 
 
 If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub
```
