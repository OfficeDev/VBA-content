# SpellingSuggestion Object (Word)

Represents a single spelling suggestion for a misspelled word. The  **SpellingSuggestion** object is a member of the **[SpellingSuggestions](7e0fb008-e43c-c4cb-b7d2-9436d039a070.md)** collection. The **SpellingSuggestions** collection includes all the suggestions for a specified word or for the first word in the specified range.


## Remarks

Use  **GetSpellingSuggestions** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **SpellingSuggestion** object. The following example checks to see whether there are any spelling suggestions for the first word in the active document. If there are, the first suggestion is displayed in a message box.


```vb
If ActiveDocument.Words(1).GetSpellingSuggestions.Count <> 0 Then 
 MsgBox _ 
 ActiveDocument.Words(1).GetSpellingSuggestions.Item(1).Name 
EndIf
```

The  **Count** property for the **SpellingSuggestions** object returns 0 (zero) if the word is spelled correctly or if there are no suggestions.
