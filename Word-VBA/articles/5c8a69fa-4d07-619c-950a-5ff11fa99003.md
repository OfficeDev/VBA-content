Applies formatting copied with the  **CopyFormat** method to the selection.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **PasteFormat**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If a paragraph mark was selected when the  **CopyFormat** method was used, Word applies paragraph formatting in addition to character formatting.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example copies the paragraph and character formatting from the first paragraph in the selection to the next paragraph in the selection.


```
With Selection 
 .Paragraphs(1).Range.Select 
 .CopyFormat 
 .Paragraphs(1).Next.Range.Select 
 .PasteFormat 
End With
```

This example collapses the selection and copies the character formatting to the next word.




```
With Selection 
 .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
 .CopyFormat 
 .Next(Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1).Select 
 .PasteFormat 
End With
```
