# Range.WholeStory Method (Word)

Expands a range to include the entire story.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **WholeStory**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


## Remarks

The following instructions, where  _myRange_ is a valid **Range** object, are functionally equivalent:


```
myRange.WholeStory 
myRange.Expand Unit:=wdStory
```


## Example

This example expands  _myRange_ to include the entire story and then applies the Arial font to the range.


```vb
Set myRange = Selection.Range 
myRange.WholeStory 
myRange.Font.Name = "Arial"
```

This example expands  _myRange_ to include the entire comments story ( **wdCommentsStory** ) and then copies the comments into a new document.




```vb
If ActiveDocument.Comments.Count >= 1 Then 
 Set myRange = Activedocument.Comments(1).Range 
 myRange.WholeStory 
 myRange.Copy 
 Documents.Add.Content.Paste 
End If
```
