## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 **Selection** objects have starting and ending character positions. The starting position refers to the character position closest to the beginning of the story. If this property is set to a value larger than that of the **End** property, the **End** property is set to the same value as that of **Start** property.

This property returns the starting character position relative to the beginning of the story. The main text story ( **wdMainTextStory**) begins with character position 0 (zero). You can change the size of a selection, range, or bookmark by setting this property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example determines the length of the selection by comparing the starting and ending character positions.


```
SelLength = Selection.End - Selection.Start
```
