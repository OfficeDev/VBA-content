# Points Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [Point](349ea9a3-9e9a-b26f-146f-799d39c3d4a9.md)** objects in the specified series in a chart.

## Remarks

Use  ** [Points](31f5763b-fdb9-de54-aff7-6fb3dc540a53.md)**( _Index_), where  _Index_ is the point index number, to return a single **Point** object. Points are numbered from left to right on the series. `Points(1)` is the leftmost point, and `Points(Points.Count)` is the rightmost point.


## Example

Use the  **Points** method to return the **Points** collection. The following example adds a data label to the last point in series one for the first chart in the active document.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Points 
 .Item(.Count).ApplyDataLabels Type:=xlShowValue 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```

 The following example sets the marker style for the third point in series one for the first chart in the active document. The specified series must be a 2-D line, scatter, or radar series.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Points(3).MarkerStyle = xlDiamond 
 End If 
End With
```
