# Subdocument Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a subdocument within a document or range. The  **Subdocument** object is a member of the ** [Subdocuments](8e14fced-19b3-2794-39a3-9e5ec15dd0ad.md)**collection. The  **Subdocuments** collection includes all the subdocuments in the a range or document.

## Remarks

Use  **Subdocuments**(Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single  **Subdocument** object. The following example displays the path and file name of the first subdocument in the active document.


```
If ActiveDocument.Subdocuments(1).HasFile = True Then 
 MsgBox ActiveDocument.Subdocuments(1).Path &amp; _ 
 Application.PathSeparator &amp; _ 
 ActiveDocument.Subdocuments(1).Name 
End If
```

Use the  **AddFromFile**or  **AddFromRange**method to add a subdocument to a document. The following example adds a subdocument named "Setup.doc" at the end of the active document.




```
ActiveDocument.Subdocuments.Expanded = True 
Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdStory 
Selection.InsertParagraphBefore 
ActiveDocument.Subdocuments.AddFromFile Name:="C:\Temp\Setup.doc"
```

The following example applies the Heading 1 style to the first paragraph in the selection and then creates a subdocument for the contents of the selection.




```
Selection.Paragraphs(1).Style = wdStyleHeading1 
With ActiveDocument.Subdocuments 
 .Expanded = True 
 .AddFromRange Range:=Selection.Range 
End With
```
