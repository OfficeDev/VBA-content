To add  [ActiveX controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/befa20c2-c4e7-1a53-7740-248885691710%28Office.15%29.aspx)to a user form, find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox**, drag the control onto the form, and then drag an adjustment handle on the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want.


 **Note**  Dragging a control (or a number of "grouped" controls) from the form back to the  **Toolbox** creates a template of that control, which can be reused. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard interface for your applications.

When you've added controls to the form, use the commands on the  **Format** menu in the Visual Basic Editor to adjust the control alignment and spacing.
