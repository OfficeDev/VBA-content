Returns the word or phrase that was looked up by the thesaurus. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Word**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [SynonymInfo](0af2d733-a038-1f67-ddca-2b05b3af1b7c.md)**object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The thesaurus will sometimes look up a shortened version of the string or range used to return the  **SynonymInfo**object. The  **Word** property allows you to see the exact string that was used.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example returns a list of synonyms for the first meaning of the third word in the active document.


```
Sub Syn() 
 Dim mySynObj As Object 
 Dim SList As Variant 
 Dim i As Variant 
 
 Set mySynObj = ActiveDocument.Words(3).SynonymInfo 
 SList = mySynObj.SynonymList(1) 
 For i = 1 To UBound(SList) 
 MsgBox "A synonym for " &amp; mySynObj.Word _ 
 &amp; " is " &amp; SList(i) 
 Next i 
End Sub
```

This example checks to make sure that the word or phrase that was looked up isn't empty. If it is not, the example returns a list of synonyms for the first meaning of the word or phrase.




```
Sub SelectWord() 
 Dim mySynObj As Object 
 Dim SList As Variant 
 Dim i As Variant 
 
 Set mySynObj = Selection.Range.SynonymInfo 
 If mySynObj.Word = "" Then 
 MsgBox "Please select a word or phrase" 
 Else 
 SList = mySynObj.SynonymList(1) 
 For i = 1 To UBound(SList) 
 MsgBox "A synonym for " &amp; mySynObj.Word _ 
 &amp; " is " &amp; SList(i) 
 Next i 
 End If 
End Sub 

```
