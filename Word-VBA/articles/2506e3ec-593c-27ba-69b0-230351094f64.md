Moves the start position of the specified range until one of the specified characters is found in the document.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **MoveStartUntil**( **_Cset_**,  **_Count_**)

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cset|Required| **Variant**|One or more characters. This argument is case sensitive.|
|Count|Optional| **Variant**|The maximum number of characters by which the specified range is to be moved. Can be a number or either the  **wdForward** or **wdBackward** constant. If Count is a positive number, the range is moved forward in the document. If it is a negative number, the range is moved backward. The default value is **wdForward**.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the movement is backward through the document, the range is expanded.

This method returns the number of characters by which the start position of the specified range moved, as a  **Long** value. If Count is greater than 0 (zero), this method returns the number of characters moved plus 1. If Count is less than 0 (zero), this method returns the number of characters moved minus 1. If no Cset characters are found, the specified range isn't changed and the method returns 0 (zero). If the start position is moved forward to a point beyond the end position, the range is collapsed and both the start and end positions are moved together.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

If there is a dollar sign character ($) in the first paragraph in the selected text, this example moves  _myRange_ just before the dollar sign.


```
Set myRange = Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range 
leng = myRange.End - myRange.Start 
myRange.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
myRange.MoveStartUntil Cset:="$", Count:=leng
```
