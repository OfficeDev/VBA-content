# CoAuthLock Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a lock within the document. The  **CoAuthLock** object is a member of the ** [CoAuthLocks](589763ed-8463-6988-3817-9c2152506d16.md)** collection.

## Remarks

Use  **Locks**(index), where index is the index number, to return a  **CoAuthLock** object. When adding a **CoAuthLock** object, use the ** [WdLockType](2c861165-b6b7-5518-1569-628469b099cd.md)** enumeration to specify the type of lock.


## Example

The following code example returns the first lock in the active document.


```
Dim myLock as CoAuthLock 
 
Set myLock = ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Locks(1)
```

The following code example adds a reservation lock on the third paragraph in the active document. Reservation locks are explicitly created by a document author and are persisted across explicit save actions (locks of type  **wdLockEphemeral** do not persist across explicit saves). You can add locks with a with a lock type of **wdLockReservation** using the Word ribbon. For example, you can create a reservation lock on a selected paragraph range using **Block Authors** on the **Review** tab.




```
ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Locks.Add(ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(3), wdLockReservation)
```
