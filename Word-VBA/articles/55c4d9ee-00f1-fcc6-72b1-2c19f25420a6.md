## Determining whether text is selected
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  ** [Type](75af6b1a-c9d3-e3ad-52a8-41d91c79b007.md)**property of the  ** [Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)**object returns information about the type of selection. The following example displays a message if the selection is an insertion point.


```
Sub IsTextSelected() 
 If Selection.Type = wdSelectionIP Then MsgBox "Nothing is selected" 
End Sub
```


## Collapsing a selection or range
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use the  **Collapse**method to collapse a  **Selection** object or a ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)**object to its beginning or ending point. The following example collapses the selection to an insertion point at the beginning of the selection.


```
Sub CollapseToBeginning() 
 Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
End Sub
```

The following example cancels the range to its ending point (after the first word) and adds new text.




```
Sub CollapseToEnd() 
 Dim rngWords As Range 
 
 Set rngWords = ActiveDocument.Words(1) 
 With rngWords 
 .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
 .Text = "(This is a test.) " 
 End With 
End Sub
```


## Extending a selection or range
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example uses the  ** [MoveEnd](11fbcd45-16e6-611b-d296-a88cc7d3ca50.md)**method of the  **Selection** object to extend the end of the selection to include three additional words. The ** [MoveLeft](23c22588-e774-f70f-28ea-81b1a54c0dd5.md)**,  ** [MoveRight](fcac96c7-7189-87b2-d800-9d161edb1e09.md)**,  ** [MoveUp](46993371-c916-06b5-a644-960f8a283536.md)**, and  ** [MoveDown](d3ea31e8-04a5-c342-24ca-c93ac1a1258e.md)**methods can also be used to extend a  **Selection** object.


```
Sub ExtendSelection() 
 Selection.MoveEnd Unit:=wdWord, Count:=3 
End Sub
```

The following example uses the  ** [MoveEnd](44aa26e6-7bb1-af51-8d23-244444e0795c.md)** method of the ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object to extend the range to include the first three paragraphs in the active document.




```
Sub ExtendRange() 
 Dim rngParagraphs As Range 
 
 Set rngParagraphs = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range 
 rngParagraphs.MoveEnd Unit:=wdParagraph, Count:=2 
End Sub
```


## Redefining a selection or range
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

Use the  **SetRange**method to redefine an existing  **Selection** object or **Range** object. For more information, see [Working with the Selection object](a1ef7e48-5a0f-d278-4b67-7b96f4e24052.md) or [Working with Range objects](9e240aa7-8608-9d70-aee3-2e202687459e.md).


## Changing text
<a name="sectionSection4"> </a>

You can change existing text by changing the contents of a range. The following instruction changes the first word in the active document by setting the  ** [Text](495fe06e-ba87-0d96-9f6e-3e62fd71d4a5.md)**property of a  **Range** object to "The ".


```
Sub ChangeText() 
 ActiveDocument.Words(1).Text = "The " 
End Sub
```

You can also use the  **Delete**method or the  **Selection** object or the **Range** object to delete existing text, and then insert new text using the **InsertAfter**method or the  **InsertBefore**method. The following example deletes the first paragraph in the active document and inserts new text.




```
Sub DeleteText() 
 Dim rngFirstParagraph As Range 
 
 Set rngFirstParagraph = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range 
 With rngFirstParagraph 
 .Delete 
 .InsertAfter Text:="New text" 
 .InsertParagraphAfter 
 End With 
End Sub
```
