# Paragraph Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a single paragraph in a selection, range, or document. The  **Paragraph** object is a member of the ** [Paragraphs](bdc7a183-2a98-7d47-c86a-5cecd6c91449.md)**collection. The  **Paragraphs** collection includes all the paragraphs in a selection, range, or document.

## Remarks

Use  **Paragraphs**(Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single  **Paragraph** object. The following example right aligns the first paragraph in the active document.


```
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Alignment = wdAlignParagraphRight
```

Use the  **Add**,  **InsertParagraph**,  **InsertParagraphAfter**, or  **InsertParagraphBefore**method to add a new, blank paragraph to a document. The following example adds a paragraph mark before the first paragraph in the selection.




```
Selection.Paragraphs.Add Range:=Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range
```

The following example also adds a paragraph mark before the first paragraph in the selection.




```
Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range.InsertParagraphBefore
```
