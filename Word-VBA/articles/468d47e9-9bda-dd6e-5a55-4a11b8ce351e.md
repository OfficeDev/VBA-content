# Font.NumberSpacing Property (Word)

Returns or sets the number spacing setting for a font. Read/write [WdNumberSpacing](46dd4d4d-aab4-2ae8-eff1-e6bf7567a0c9.md).


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **NumberSpacing**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[Font](bc97f4df-fc81-d6c8-e99a-d50dc793b7ae.md)** object.


## Remarks

OpenType fonts support a proportional and tabular figure feature to control number spacing. Proportional number spacing handles each number as having a different width. For example, "1" is displayed as narrower than "5". Tabular number spacing handles numbers as equal in width so that they align vertically, which increases the readability, especially for financial information.


## Example

The following code example sets the number spacing to proportional for the font in the active document.


```vb
ActiveDocument.Range.Font.NumberSpacing = wdNumberSpacingProportional
```
