# FootnoteOptions Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the properties assigned to a range or selection of footnotes in a document.

## Remarks

Use the  **Range** or **Selection** object to return a **FootnoteOptions** object. Using the **FootnoteOptions** object, you can assign different footnote properties to different areas of a document. For example, you may want footnotes in the introduction of a long document to be displayed as lowercase letters, while in the rest of your document they are displayed as asterisks. The following example uses the **NumberingRule**,  **NumberStyle**, and  **StartingNumber** properties to format the footnotes in the first section of the active document.


```
Sub BookIntro() 
 Dim rngIntro As Range 
 
 'Sets the range as section one of the active document 
 Set rngIntro = ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Range 
 
 'Formats the EndnoteOptions properties 
 With rngIntro.FootnoteOptions 
 .NumberingRule = wdRestartPage 
 .NumberStyle = wdNoteNumberStyleLowercaseLetter 
 .StartingNumber = 1 
 End With 
End Sub
```
