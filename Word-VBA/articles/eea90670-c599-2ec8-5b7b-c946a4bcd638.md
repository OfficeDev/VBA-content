# ChartBorder Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the border of an object.

## Remarks

Most bordered objects have a border that is treated as a single entity, regardless of how many sides it has. The entire border must be returned as a unit. To return a  **Border** object, use the **Border** property for the particular bordered object (for example, the ** [Border](43cf81c8-ad8d-fbd4-1b06-82e2490c8e10.md)** property of a ** [TrendLine](1cfe897f-26ad-a838-ed9b-f3fd945ff7ea.md)** object).


## Example

 The following example changes the type and line style of a trendline on the active chart.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Trendlines(1) 
 .Type = xlLinear 
 .Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
End With
```
