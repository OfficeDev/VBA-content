Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis in degrees. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RotationX**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [ThreeDFormat](d397e780-a53d-0cc3-7a02-b40397253e91.md)**object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **RotationX** property can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates upward rotation; a negative value indicates downward rotation.

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, use the  ** [RotationY](64ebb9d9-4338-3672-9149-e1e82ba8abdc.md)**property of the ThreeDFormat object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the  ** [Rotation](7a66bdd7-ffda-64f2-8228-c1bce6d0640b.md)**property of the  ** [Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)**object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the  ** [SetExtrusionDirection](651b2b17-d87b-0007-3722-dc330f3e1f2e.md)**method.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to the active document and sets their rotation around the x-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 90, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 150, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = 30 
 End With 
End With
```
