# ChartGroup Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents one or more series plotted in a chart with the same format.

## Remarks

A chart contains one or more chart groups, each chart group contains one or more ** [Series](212c323f-8acb-2ba7-1359-ab0f43268e77.md)** objects, and each series contains one or more ** [Points](d0adc45a-7b31-a25e-d96f-f2a098702501.md)** objects. For example, a single chart might contain both a line chart group, which contains all the series plotted with the line chart format, and a bar chart group, which contains all the series plotted with the bar chart format. The **ChartGroup** object is a member of the ** [ChartGroups](37136fbd-8740-c817-9666-993bc5d4c847.md)** collection.

Use  **ChartGroups**( _Index_), where  _index_ is the chart group index number, to return a single **ChartGroup** object.


## Example

The following example adds drop lines to the first chart group of the first chart in the active document.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart 
 .ChartGroups(1).HasDropLines = True 
End With
```
