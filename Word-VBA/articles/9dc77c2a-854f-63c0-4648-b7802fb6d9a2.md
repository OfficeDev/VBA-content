# Gridlines Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents major or minor gridlines on a chart axis.

## Remarks

 Gridlines extend the tick marks on a chart axis to make it easier to see the values associated with the data markers. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single gridline; you either enable all gridlines for an axis or disable all of them.

Use the  ** [MajorGridlines](90e0d7c0-add7-9a34-8706-aaf33f799441.md)** property to return the **GridLines** object that represents the major gridlines for the axis. Use the ** [MinorGridlines](b234c5ca-0381-6834-b2f9-fae3048a2fbf.md)** property to return the **GridLines** object that represents the minor gridlines. It is possible to return both major and minor gridlines at the same time.


## Example

The following example enables major gridlines for the category axis of the first chart in the active document and then formats the gridlines to be blue dashed lines.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart.Axes(xlCategory) 
 .HasMajorGridlines = True 
 .MajorGridlines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
 .MajorGridlines.Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```
