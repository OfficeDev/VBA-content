 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns or sets the ending character position of a range. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **End**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 **Range** objects all have a starting position and an ending position. The ending position is the point farthest away from the beginning of the story. If this property is set to a value smaller than the ** [Start](aadedbb7-1ee2-9e5a-296d-0ebe25b6d8f4.md)** property, the **Start** property is set to the same value (that is, the **Start** and **End** property are equal).

This property returns the ending character position relative to the beginning of the story. The main document story ( **wdMainTextStory**) begins with character position 0 (zero). You can change the size of a selection, range, or bookmark by setting this property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example changes the ending position of myRange by one character.


```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range 
myRange.End = myRange.End - 1
```
