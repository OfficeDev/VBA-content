# Reviewers Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  ** [Reviewer](d7824ac4-d62a-b8f8-a80c-6999a999456c.md)** objects that represents the reviewers of one or more documents. The **Reviewers** collection contains the names of all reviewers who have reviewed documents opened or edited on a computer.

## Remarks

Use  **Reviewers**(Index), where Index is the name or index number of the reviewer, to return a single reviewer in the  **Reviewers** collection. This example hides revisions made by the first reviewer in the **Reviewers** collection.


```
Sub HideAuthorRevisions(blnRev As Boolean) 
 ActiveWindow.View.Reviewers(Index:=1) _ 
 .Visible = False 
End Sub
```
