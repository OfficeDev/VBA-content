# Document Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a document. The  **Document** object is a member of the ** [Documents](fc4ac973-19c1-703a-5538-f4426b8b7564.md)**collection. The  **Documents** collection contains all the **Document** objects that are currently open in Word.

## Remarks

Use  ** [Documents](7e477cb3-ae65-685a-0083-1826efe86703.md)**(Index), where Index is the document name or index number to return a single  **Document** object. The following example closes the document named "Report.doc" without saving changes.


```
Documents("Report.doc").Close SaveChanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges
```

The index number represents the position of the document in the  **Documents** collection. The following example activates the first document in the **Documents** collection.




```
Documents(1).Activate
```

Using ActiveDocument

You can use the  ** [ActiveDocument](c20a7c9f-f8a4-7913-f53f-10baa6807def.md)** property to refer to the document with the focus. The following example uses the ** [Activate](83cc5935-020b-470a-f7aa-7fea057ec08b.md)** method to activate the document named "Document 1." The example also sets the page orientation to landscape mode and then prints the document.




```
Documents("Document1").Activate 
ActiveDocument.PageSetup.Orientation = wdOrientLandscape 
ActiveDocument.PrintOut
```
