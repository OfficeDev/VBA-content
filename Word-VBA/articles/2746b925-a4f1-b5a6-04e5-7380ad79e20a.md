 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **MsoTrue** if the shadow of the specified shape appears filled in and is obscured by the shape, even if the shape has no fill. **MsoFalse** if the shadow has no fill and the outline of the shadow is visible through the shape if the shape has no fill. Read/write **MsoTriState**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Obscured**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [ShadowFormat](2a179f0b-ec18-c3dd-dd73-51b18f42e0e2.md)** object.


## Example

This example sets the horizontal and vertical offsets for the shadow of shape three on myDocument. The shadow is offset 5 points to the right of the shape and 3 points above it. If the shape doesn't already have a shadow, this example adds one to it. The shadow will be filled in and obscured by the shape, even if the shape has no fill.


```
Set myDocument = ActiveDocument 
With myDocument.Shapes(3).Shadow 
 .Visible = True 
 .OffsetX = 5 
 .OffsetY = -3 
 .Obscured = msoTrue 
End With
```
