### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Factor|Required| **Single**|Specifies the ratio between the width of the shape after you resize it and the current or original width. For example, to make a rectangle 50 percent larger, specify 1.5 for this argument.|
|RelativeToOriginalSize|Required| **MsoTriState**| **True** to scale the shape relative to its original size. **False** to scale it relative to its current size. You can specify **True** for this argument only if the specified shape is a picture or an OLE object.|
|Scale|Optional| **MsoScaleFrom**|The part of the shape that retains its position when the shape is scaled.|
