# DropLines Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the drop lines in a chart group.

## Remarks

Drop lines connect the points in the chart with the x-axis. Only line and area chart groups can have drop lines. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single drop line; you either enable drop lines for all points in a chart group or you disable them.

If the  ** [HasDropLines](34743dd3-73f6-d125-a240-23984d31fa47.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the  **DropLines** object are disabled.


## Example

Use the  ** [DropLines](eebe1c74-5682-4680-56d2-f0190fec5950.md)** property to return the **DropLines** object. The following example enables drop lines for chart group one of the first chart in the active document and then sets the drop line color to red.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasDropLines = True 
 .DropLines.Border.ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```
