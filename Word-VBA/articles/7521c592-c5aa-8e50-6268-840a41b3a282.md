# SeriesLines Object (Word)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents series lines in a chart group.

## Remarks

 Series lines connect the data values from each series. Only 2-D stacked bar, 2-D stacked column, pie-of-pie, or bar-of-pie charts can have series lines. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single series line; you either enable series lines for all points in a chart group or you disable them.

If the  ** [HasSeriesLines](56e85d95-4743-4afd-5bdf-d00065608708.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the  **SeriesLines** object are disabled.


## Example

Use the  ** [SeriesLines](23f36b19-99ed-f4d5-23b5-a8cd35bbf75c.md)** property to return a **SeriesLines** object. The following example adds series lines to chart group one in embedded chart one on worksheet one (the chart must be a 2-D stacked bar or column chart).


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasSeriesLines = True 
 .SeriesLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```
