|Count|Optional| **Variant**|The maximum number of units by which the specified selection is to be moved. If Count is a positive number, the start position of the selection is moved forward in the document. If it is a negative number, the start position is moved backward. If the start position is moved forward to a position beyond the end position, the selection is collapsed and both the start and end positions are moved together. The default value is 1.|

### Return Value

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example moves the start position of the selection one character forward (the selection size is reduced by one character). Note that a space is considered a character.


```
Selection.MoveStart Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1
```

This example moves the start position of the selection to the beginning of the line (the selection is extended to the start of the line).
