# HiLoLines Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the high-low lines in a chart group.

## Remarks

 High-low lines connect the highest point with the lowest point in every category in the chart group. Only 2-D line groups can have high-low lines. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single high-low line; you either enable high-low lines for all points in a chart group or disable them.

If the  ** [HasHiLoLines](02122126-1ea9-0d94-ce1b-25b1aa9d075b.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the  **HiLoLines** object are disabled.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

Use the  ** [HiLoLines](3b575e71-79c9-83d8-4c2d-dfc36480099f.md)** property to return the **HiLoLines** object. The following example uses the **HasHiLowLines** property to add high-low lines to the first chart (the chart must be a line chart) in the active document. The example then makes the high-low lines blue.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        With Chart.ChartGroups(1)

            .HasHighLowLines = True

            .HiLoLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255)

        End With

    End If

End With
```
