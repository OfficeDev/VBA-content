# Shape.Tags Property (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns a  ** [Tags](75ecbd43-0aa7-d49d-f1f5-c6c21d8babee.md)**object that represents the tags for the specified object. Read-only.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Tags**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


### Return Value

Tags


## Example


 **Note**  Tag values are added and stored in uppercase text. You should perform tests on tag values using uppercase text, as shown in the second example.

This example adds a tag named "REGION" and a tag named "PRIORITY" to slide one in the active presentation.


```
With Application.ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Tags

    .Add "Region", "East"     'Adds "Region" tag with value "East"

    .Add "Priority", "Low"    'Adds "Priority" tag with value "Low"

End With
```

This example searches through the tags for each slide in the active presentation. If there's a tag named "PRIORITY," a message box displays the tag value. If the object doesn't have a tag named "PRIORITY," the example adds this tag with the value "Unknown."




```
For Each s In Application.ActivePresentation.Slides

    With s.Tags

        found = False

        For i = 1 To .Count

          If .Name(i) = "PRIORITY" Then

              found = True

              slNum = .Parent.SlideIndex

              MsgBox "Slide " &amp; slNum &amp; " Priority: " &amp; .Value(i)

          End If

        Next

        If Not found Then

          slNum = .Parent.SlideIndex

          .Add "Priority", "Unknown"

          MsgBox "Slide " &amp; slNum &amp; " Priority tag added: Unknown"

        End If

    End With

Next
```
