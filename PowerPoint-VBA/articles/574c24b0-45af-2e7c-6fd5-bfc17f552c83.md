## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you don't get the effect you expect, check your other build settings. You won't see the effect of the  **DimColor** property unless the ** [TextLevelEffect](008e3db2-2d22-5218-c312-663f0106adc6.md)**property of the  **AnimationSettings** object is set to something other than **ppAnimateLevelNone**, the  ** [AfterEffect](18fd4307-c737-2a97-09bc-ff381a18d768.md)**property is set to  **ppAfterEffectDim**, and the  ** [Animate](7434630f-3c73-4261-36f7-a26d45e9df11.md)**property is set to  **True**. In addition, if the specified shape is the only item or the last item to be built on the slide, the shape won't be dimmed. To change the build order of the shapes on a slide, use the  ** [AnimationOrder](0a29fb35-1cd8-4d12-184e-1132494a0864.md)**property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds a slide that contains both a title and a three-item list to the active presentation, sets the title and list to be dimmed after being built, and sets the color that each of them will be dimmed to.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides.Add(2, ppLayoutText).Shapes

    With .Item(1)

        .TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "Sample title"

        With .AnimationSettings

            .TextLevelEffect = ppAnimateByAllLevels

            .AfterEffect = ppAfterEffectDim

            .DimColor.SchemeColor = ppShadow

            .Animate = True

        End With

    End With

    With .Item(2)

        .TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "Item one" _

            &amp; Chr(13) &amp; "Item two"

        With .AnimationSettings

            .TextLevelEffect = ppAnimateByFirstLevel

            .AfterEffect = ppAfterEffectDim

            .DimColor.RGB = RGB(100, 150, 130)

            .Animate = True

        End With

    End With

End With
```
