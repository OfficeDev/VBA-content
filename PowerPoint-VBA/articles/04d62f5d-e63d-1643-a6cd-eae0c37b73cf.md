# Series.Formula Property (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets the object's formula in A1-style notation and in the language of the macro. Read/write  **String**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Formula**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  ** [Series](5c8c2d92-d8ca-4d21-e213-c374292275d4.md)** object.


## Remarks

This property is not available for OLAP data sources.

If the object contains a constant, this property returns the constant. If the object is empty, this property returns an empty string. If the object contains a formula, this property returns the formula as a string in the same format that would be displayed in the formula bar (including the equal sign).

If the range is a one- or two-dimensional range, you can set the formula to a Visual Basic array of the same dimensions. Similarly, you can put the formula into a Visual Basic array.
