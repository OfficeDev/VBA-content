# Create UserForms

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

To create a custom dialog box, you must create a UserForm. To create a UserForm, click  **UserForm** on the **Insert** menu in the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor.

Use the Properties window to change the name, behavior, and appearance of the form. For example, to change the caption on a form, set the  **Caption** property.
