 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs immediately before the transition to the next slide. For the first slide, occurs immediately after the  ** [SlideShowBegin](f70ca9cb-11a7-2a81-19bb-36e0b0ca0b97.md)** event.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SlideShowNextSlide**( **_Wn_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Wn|Required| **SlideShowWindow**|The active slide show window.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For information about using events with the  **Application** object, see [How to: Use Events with the Application Object](b657ab62-67fa-4eeb-736c-86e31a026c73.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example determines the slide position for the slide following the  **SlideShowNextSlide** event. If the next slide is slide three, the example changes the type of pointer to a pen and the pen color to red.


```
Private Sub App_SlideShowNextSlide(ByVal Wn As SlideShowWindow)



   Dim Showpos As Integer



   Showpos = Wn.View.CurrentShowPosition + 1

If Showpos = 3 Then  

         With ActivePresentation.SlideShowSettings.Run.View

            .PointerColor.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0)

            .PointerType = ppSlideShowPointerPen

         End With

      Else

         With ActivePresentation.SlideShowSettings.Run.View

            .PointerColor.RGB = RGB(0, 0, 0)

            .PointerType = ppSlideShowPointerArrow

         End With

      End If

End Sub
```

This example sets a global counter variable to zero. Then it calculates the number of shapes on the slide following this event, determines which shapes have animation, and fills a global array with the animation order and the number of each shape.


 **Note**  The array created in this example is also used in the  **SlideShowNextBuild** event example.




```
Private Sub App_SlideShowNextSlide(ByVal Wn As SlideShowWindow)



   Dim i as Integer, j as Integer, numShapes As Integer

   Dim objSld As Slide



   Set objSld = ActivePresentation.Slides _

        (ActivePresentation.SlideShowWindow.View _

        .CurrentShowPosition + 1)

      With objSld.Shapes

         numShapes = .Count

         If numShapes > 0 Then

            j = 1

            ReDim shpAnimArray(1 To 2, 1 To numShapes)

            For i = 1 To numShapes

               If .Item(i).AnimationSettings.Animate Then

                  shpAnimArray(1, j) = _

                     .Item(i).AnimationSettings.AnimationOrder

                     shpAnimArray(2, j) = i

                     j = j + 1

               End If

            Next

         End If

      End With

End Sub
```
