# Walls Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the walls of a 3-D chart. 

## Remarks

This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single wall; you must return all the walls as a unit.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

Use the  ** [Walls](e4c019c0-41de-988b-b5c7-009fcc0eee15.md)** property to return the **Walls** object. The following example sets the pattern on the walls for the first chart in the active document. If the chart is not a 3-D chart, this example will fail.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.Walls.Interior.Pattern = xlGray75

    End If

End With
```
