## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Microsoft Office PowerPoint-specific add-ins are identified by a .ppa or .ppam file name extension. Component Object Model (COM) add-ins can be used universally across Microsoft programming products and have a .dll or .exe file name extension.

For information about returning a single member of a collection, see  [Returning an Object from a Collection](d81e1323-aa12-fa1a-aa75-3cc21d06c75f.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds the add-in named "Myaddin.ppa" to the list in the  **Add-Ins** dialog box and loads the add-in automatically.


```
Set myAddIn = Application.AddIns.Add(FileName:="c:\myaddin.ppa")

myAddIn.Loaded = True

MsgBox myAddIn.Name &amp; " has been added to the list"


```
