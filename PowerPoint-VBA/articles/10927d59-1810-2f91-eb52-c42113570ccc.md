## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If more than one placeholder of a specified type has been deleted from the slide, the  **AddPlaceholder** method will add them back to the slide, one by one, starting with the placeholder that has the lowest original index number.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Suppose that slide two in the active presentation originally had a title at the top of the slide that's been deleted, either manually or with the following line of code.


```
ActivePresentation.Slides(2).Shapes.Placeholders(1).Delete
```

This example restores the deleted placeholder to slide two.




```
Application.ActivePresentation.Slides(2) _

    .Shapes.AddPlaceholder ppPlaceholderTitle
```
