# ShapeNode Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform.

## Remarks

 Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The **ShapeNode** object is a member of the ** [ShapeNodes](493bacfe-eb8c-2064-46ec-c19e58e9b1ce.md)**collection. The  **ShapeNodes** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.


## Example

Use  **Nodes**(index), where index is the node index number, to return a single  **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on `myDocument` is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(3)

    If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then

        .Nodes.SetEditingType 1, msoEditingSmooth

    End If

End With
```
