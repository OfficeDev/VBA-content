# ThemeVariants Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  ** [ThemeVariant](de00374f-05fd-4cae-08f8-ef417cd944b5.md)** objects that represent variations in the theme.

## Example

This example opens a theme file, iterates through the variants in the theme, and prints the name and ID of each variation in the theme.


```
Sub IterateThemeVariants()

    Dim pptTheme As Theme
    Dim pptThemeVariants As ThemeVariants
    Dim pptThemeVariant As ThemeVariant
    Dim path As String
    
    ' Get a reference to the currently active theme.
    path = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Document Themes 15\" &amp; _
        ActivePresentation.TemplateName &amp; ".thmx"
    Set pptTheme = Application.OpenThemeFile(path)
    
    ' Get a reference to all of the variations in the theme.
    Set pptThemeVariants = pptTheme.ThemeVariants
    
    ' Iterate over each variation of the theme and print
    ' its name and ID.
    For Each pptThemeVariant In pptThemeVariants
    
        Debug.Print "Variation " &amp; pptThemeVariant.name &amp; " id: " &amp; pptThemeVariant.Id
    
    Next pptThemeVariant

End Sub
```
