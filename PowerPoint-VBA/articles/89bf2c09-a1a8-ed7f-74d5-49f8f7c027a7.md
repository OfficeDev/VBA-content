 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters

Private Sub App_WindowDeactivate (ByVal Pres As Presentation, ByVal Wn As DocumentWindow)

    FindNum = InStr(1, Wn.Presentation.FullName, ".")

    If FindNum = 0 Then

        HTMLName = Wn.Presentation.FullName &amp; ".htm"

    Else

        HTMLName = Mid(Wn.Presentation.FullName, 1, FindNum - 1) _

            &amp; ".htm"

    End If

    Wn.Presentation.SaveCopyAs HTMLName, ppSaveAsHTML

    MsgBox "Presentation being saved in HTML format as " _

        &amp; HTMLName &amp; " ."

End Sub


```
