# RulerLevel Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains first-line indent and hanging indent information for an outline level. 

## Remarks

The  **RulerLevel** object is a member of the ** [RulerLevels](890f4bee-c48a-be48-2cac-b73736a5bdf0.md)**collection. The  **RulerLevels** collection contains a **RulerLevel** object for each of the five available outline levels.


## Example

Use  **RulerLevels**(index), where index is the outline level, to return a single  **RulerLevel** object. The following example sets the first-line indent and hanging indent for outline level one in body text on the slide master for the active presentation.


```
With ActivePresentation.SlideMaster _

        .TextStyles(ppBodyStyle).Ruler.Levels(1)

    .FirstMargin = 9

    .LeftMargin = 54

End With
```

The following example sets the first-line indent and hanging indent for outline level one in shape two on slide one in the active presentation.




```
With ActivePresentation.SlideMaster.Shapes(2) _

        .TextFrame.Ruler.Levels(1)

    .FirstMargin = 9

    .LeftMargin = 54

End With
```
