| **msoFalse**|Default. PowerPoint doesn't return to the initiating slide show from the deactivated custom slide show.|
| **msoTrue**| PowerPoint returns to the initiating slide show from a deactivated custom slide show that was activated by using the ** [ActionSetting](21381ff0-b9ff-59d8-77e9-345905fb8617.md)**object of the initiating presentation.|

## Example

This example sets the mouse click action for shape five on slide one in the active presentation to show the custom slide show named "techtalk." When the custom slide show is over, it automatically returns to the initiating presentation, in the state before the mouse click occurred.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(5).ActionSettings(ppMouseClick)

    .Action = ppActionNamedSlideShow

    .SlideShowName = "techtalk"

    .ShowandReturn = msoTrue

End With
```
