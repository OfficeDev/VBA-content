# ExtraColors Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the extra colors in a presentation. The object can contain up to eight colors, each of which is represented by an red-green-blue (RGB) value.

## Example

Use the  [ExtraColors](c6a9d155-206c-36e6-c180-aaff8bd85a99.md)property to return the  **ExtraColors** object. Use **ExtraColors**(index), where index is the extra color index number, to return the red-green-blue (RGB) value for a single extra color. The following example adds a rectangle to slide one in the active presentation and sets its fill foreground color to the first extra color. If there hasn't been at least one extra color defined for the presentation, this example will fail.


```
With ActivePresentation

    Set rect = .Slides(1).Shapes _

        .AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 50, 50, 100, 200)

    rect.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = .ExtraColors(1)

End With
```

Use the  [Add](0f4bcac0-fbcf-a6a9-18c2-b4b4fb231cf9.md)method to add an extra color. The following example adds an extra color to the active presentation (if the color hasn't already been added).




```
ActivePresentation.ExtraColors.Add RGB(69, 32, 155)
```
