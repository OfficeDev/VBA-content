 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example arranges windows one and two horizontally; in other words, each window occupies half the available vertical space and all the available horizontal space in the application window's client area. For this example to work, there must be only two document windows open.


```
Windows.Arrange ppArrangeTiled

sngHeight = Windows(1).Height                     ' available height

sngWidth = Windows(1).Width + Windows(2).Width    ' available width

With Windows(1)

    .Width = sngWidth

    .Height = sngHeight / 2

    .Left = 0

End With

With Windows(2)

    .Width = sngWidth

    .Height = sngHeight / 2

    .Top = sngHeight / 2

    .Left = 0

End With
```
