# RotationEffect.By Property (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 **In this article**
 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns a  **Single** that represents the rotation of an object by the specified number of degrees; for example, a value of 180 means to rotate the object by 180 degrees. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **By**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **RotationEffect** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The specified object will be rotated with the center of the object remaining in the same position on the screen.

If both the  **By** and ** [To](9630d2d6-818c-d86b-dbd7-54b3b2b13ad2.md)**properties are set for a rotation effect, then the value of the  **By** property is ignored.

Floating point numbers (for example, 55.5) are valid, but negative numbers are not.

Do not confuse this property with the  **ByX**or  **ByY**properties of the  ** [ScaleEffect](cb7c296e-a9ea-4ed6-87e0-a5d603da4f9f.md)**and  ** [MotionEffect](77a34f68-8806-22b8-149f-c28e0457e7e9.md)**objects, which are only used for scaling or motion effects.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds a rotation effect and changes its rotation.


```
Sub AddAndChangeRotationEffect()

    Dim effBlinds As Effect

    Dim tmlnShape As TimeLine

    Dim shpShape As Shape

    Dim animBehavior As AnimationBehavior

    Dim rtnEffect As RotationEffect



    'Sets shape, timing, and effect

    Set shpShape = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1)

    Set tmlnShape = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine

    Set effBlinds = tmlnShape.MainSequence.AddEffect _

        (Shape:=shpShape, effectId:=msoAnimEffectBlinds)



    'Adds animation behavior and sets rotation effect

    Set animBehavior = tmlnShape.MainSequence(1).Behaviors _

        .Add(Type:=msoAnimTypeRotation)

    Set rtnEffect = animBehavior.RotationEffect

    rtnEffect.By = 270

End Sub
```
