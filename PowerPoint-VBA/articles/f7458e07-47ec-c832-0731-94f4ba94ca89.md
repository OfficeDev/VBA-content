    Set sldNew = Presentations(1).Slides _

        .Add(Index:=1, Layout:=ppLayoutBlank)

    Set shpCanvas = sldNew.Shapes.AddCanvas( _

        Left:=100, Top:=100, Width:=200, Height:=200)



    With shpCanvas.CanvasItems

        .AddShape msoShapeRectangle, Left:=0, Top:=0, _

            Width:=100, Height:=100

        .AddShape msoShapeOval, Left:=0, Top:=50, _

            Width:=100, Height:=100

        .AddShape msoShapeDiamond, Left:=0, Top:=100, _

            Width:=100, Height:=100

    'Fill canvas child shapes with a pattern

    With ActiveWindow.Selection



        If .HasChildShapeRange = True Then

            .ChildShapeRange.Fill.Patterned Pattern:=msoPatternDivot
