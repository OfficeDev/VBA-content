# Hyperlinks Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [Hyperlink](c8d53079-b280-c93c-a3c9-b865d09abe1a.md)**objects on a slide or master.

## Example

Use the  [Hyperlinks](0e1d7545-815f-3be9-38b8-355f9e6e9962.md)property to return the  **Hyperlinks** collection. The following example updates all hyperlinks on slide one in the active presentation that have the specified address.


```
For Each hl In ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Hyperlinks

    If hl.Address = "c:\current work\sales.ppt" Then

        hl.Address = "c:\new\newsales.ppt"

    End If

Next
```

Use the  [Hyperlink](8654000a-bbc5-6d23-e5a7-d689bc767b1b.md)property to create a hyperlink and add it to the  **Hyperlinks** collection. The following example sets a hyperlink that will be followed when the user clicks shape three on slide one in the active presentation during a slide show and adds the new hyperlink to the collection. Note that if shape three already has a mouse-click hyperlink defined, the following example will delete this hyperlink from the collection when it adds the new one, so the number of items in the **Hyperlinks** collection won't change.




```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3) _

        .ActionSettings(ppMouseClick)

    .Action = ppActionHyperlink

    .Hyperlink.Address = "http://www.microsoft.com"

End With
```
