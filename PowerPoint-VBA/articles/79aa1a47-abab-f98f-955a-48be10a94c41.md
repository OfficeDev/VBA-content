 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents an individual animation point for an animation behavior. The  **AnimationPoint** object is a member of the ** [AnimationPoints](6ea9ebc4-791c-9781-38c3-8b0973e0d152.md)**collection. The  **AnimationPoints** collection contains all the animation points for an animation behavior.

## Example

To add or reference an  **AnimationPoint** object, use the [Add](faa75675-aac2-af60-b3a3-a142181ef10b.md)or  [Item](dc322b2e-a557-2277-ba89-1dec0b5dd9d8.md)method, respectively. Use the  [Time](19df62b1-b898-fdba-d5e4-86ac5a68cecf.md)property of an  **AnimationPoint** object to set timing between animation points. Use the ** [Value](f16879c0-25cc-46fa-cfd3-7a6a770be371.md)**property to set other animation point properties, such as color. The following example adds three animation points to the first behavior in the active presentation's main animation sequence, and then it changes colors at each animation point.


```
Sub AniPoint()



    Dim sldNewSlide As Slide

    Dim shpHeart As Shape

    Dim effCustom As Effect

    Dim aniBehavior As AnimationBehavior

    Dim aptNewPoint As AnimationPoint



    Set sldNewSlide = ActivePresentation.Slides.Add _

        (Index:=1, Layout:=ppLayoutBlank)

    Set shpHeart = sldNewSlide.Shapes.AddShape _

        (Type:=msoShapeHeart, Left:=100, Top:=100, _

        Width:=200, Height:=200)

    Set effCustom = sldNewSlide.TimeLine.MainSequence _

        .AddEffect(shpHeart, msoAnimEffectCustom)

    Set aniBehavior = effCustom.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeProperty)



    With aniBehavior.PropertyEffect

        .Property = msoAnimShapeFillColor

        Set aptNewPoint = .Points.Add

        aptNewPoint.Time = 0.2

        aptNewPoint.Value = RGB(0, 0, 0)

        Set aptNewPoint = .Points.Add

        aptNewPoint.Time = 0.5

        aptNewPoint.Value = RGB(0, 255, 0)

        Set aptNewPoint = .Points.Add

        aptNewPoint.Time = 1

        aptNewPoint.Value = RGB(0, 255, 255)

    End With



End Sub
```
