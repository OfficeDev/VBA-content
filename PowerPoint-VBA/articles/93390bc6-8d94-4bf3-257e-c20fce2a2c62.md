## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Crosses**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  ** [Axis](38d5e006-ac32-7bdb-f9f0-e8a858dcbf49.md)** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This property is not available for radar charts. For 3-D charts, this property can be applied only to the value axis and indicates where the plane defined by the category axes crosses the value axis.

You can use this property for both category and value axes. On the category axis,  **xlMinimum** sets the value axis to cross at the first category, and **xlMaximum** sets the value axis to cross at the last category.

Note that  **xlMinimum** and **xlMaximum** can have different meanings, depending on the axis.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example sets the value axis in for the first chart in the active document to cross the category axis at the maximum x-axis value.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

     If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.Axes(xlCategory).Crosses = xlMaximum

    End If

End With
```
