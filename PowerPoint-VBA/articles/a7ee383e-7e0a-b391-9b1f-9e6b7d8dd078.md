# PpSoundFormatType Enumeration (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Constants that specify the format of a sound file. In previous versions of Microsoft PowerPoint, these constants were passed to the  **Export** method of the **SoundFormat** object and returned by the **Type** property of that object. In Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, the **SoundFormat** object was deprecated.
