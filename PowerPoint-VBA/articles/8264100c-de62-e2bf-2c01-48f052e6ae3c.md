# SlideRange.Name Property (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

When a slide is inserted into a presentation, Microsoft PowerPoint automatically assigns it a name in the form Slide _n_, where  _n_ is an integer that represents the order in which the slide was created in the presentation. For example, the first slide inserted into a presentation is automatically named Slide1. If you copy a slide from one presentation to another, the slide loses the name it had in the first presentation and is automatically assigned a new name in the second presentation. A slide range must contain exactly one slide. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Name**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **SlideRange** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

You can use the object's name in conjunction with the  **Item** method to return a reference to the object if the **Item** method for the collection that contains the object takes a **Variant** argument. For example, if the value of the **Name** property for a shape is Rectangle 2, then `.Shapes("Rectangle 2")` will return a reference to that shape.
