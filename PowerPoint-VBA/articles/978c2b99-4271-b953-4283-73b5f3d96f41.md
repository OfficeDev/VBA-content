# Application Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the entire Microsoft PowerPoint application. 

## Remarks

The  **Application** object contains:


- Application-wide settings and options (the name of the active printer, for example).
    
- Properties that return top-level objects, such as  **ActivePresentation**, and  **Windows**.
    


When you are writing code that will run from PowerPoint, you can use the following properties of the  **Application** object without the object qualifier: **ActivePresentation**,  **ActiveWindow**,  **AddIns**,  **Presentations**,  **SlideShowWindows**,  **Windows**. 

For example, instead of writing  `Application.ActiveWindow.Height = 200`, you can write  `ActiveWindow.Height = 200`.


## Example

Use the  **Application** property to return the **Application** object. The following example returns the path to the program file.


```
Dim MyPath As String

MyPath = Application.Path
```

The following example creates a PowerPoint  **Application** object in another application, starts PowerPoint (if it is not already running), and opens an existing presentation named "Ex_a2a.ppt".




```
Set ppt = New Powerpoint.Application

ppt.Visible = True

ppt.Presentations.Open "c:\My Documents\ex_a2a.ppt"
```
