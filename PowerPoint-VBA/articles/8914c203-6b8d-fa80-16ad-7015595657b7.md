# ActionSettings Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection that contains the two  ** [ActionSetting](21381ff0-b9ff-59d8-77e9-345905fb8617.md)**objects for a shape or text range. One  **ActionSetting** object represents how the specified object reacts when the user clicks it during a slide show, and the other **ActionSetting** object represents how the specified object reacts when the user moves the mouse pointer over it during a slide show.

## Example

Use the  [ActionSettings](67e76de6-c0c3-7a35-f01e-e1cab4eb13d3.md)property to return the  **ActionSettings** collection. Use **ActionSettings**(index), where index is either  **ppMouseClick** or **ppMouseOver**, to return a single  **ActionSetting** object. The following example specifies that the CalculateTotal macro be run whenever the mouse pointer passes over the shape during a slide show.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3) _

        .ActionSettings(ppMouseOver)

    .Action = ppActionRunMacro

    .Run = "CalculateTotal"

    .AnimateAction = True

End With
```
