## Remarks

You can send OLE verbs to embedded objects using this property.

If the shape is an OLE object, then the ole object will execute the command if it understands the verb.

## Example

The following example shows how to set a command effect animation behavior.


```vb
    Set bhvEffect = effectNew.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeCommand)

 

    With bhvEffect.CommandEffect

         .Type = msoAnimCommandTypeVerb

         .Command = Play

    End With
```
