 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns how long repeated animations should last, in seconds. Read/write.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RepeatDuration**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Timing** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

An animation will stop at the end of its time sequence or the value of the  **RepeatDuration** property, whichever is shorter.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This examples adds a shape and an animation to it, then repeats the animation ten times. However, after five seconds, the animation will be cut off, even though the animation is dimensioned for a 20-second timeline (if the  **Duration** property is not specified, an animation defaults to two seconds).


```
Sub AddShapeSetTiming()

    Dim effDiamond As Effect

    Dim shpRectangle As Shape



    'Adds new shape and sets animation effect

    Set shpRectangle = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes _

        .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, Left:=100, _

        Top:=100, Width:=50, Height:=50)

    Set effDiamond = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence _

        .AddEffect(Shape:=shpRectangle, effectId:=msoAnimEffectPathDiamond)



    'Sets repeat duration and number of times to repeat animation

    With effDiamond.Timing

        .RepeatDuration = 5

        .RepeatCount = 10

    End With



End Sub
