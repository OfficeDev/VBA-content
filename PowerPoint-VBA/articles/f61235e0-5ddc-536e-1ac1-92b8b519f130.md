# FilterEffect Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a filter effect for an animation behavior.

## Remarks

Use the  **FilterEffect**property of the  ** [AnimationBehavior](70eeb4aa-b9ba-ff7d-93ee-425cf191a6cb.md)**object to return a  **FilterEffect** object. Filter effects can be changed using the **FilterEffect** object's **Reveal**,  **SubType**, and  **Type**properties.


## Example

The following example adds a shape to the first slide of the active presentation and sets a filter effect animation behavior.


```
Sub ChangeFilterEffect()

    Dim sldFirst As Slide

    Dim shpHeart As Shape

    Dim effNew As Effect

    Dim bhvEffect As AnimationBehavior



    Set sldFirst = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

    Set shpHeart = sldFirst.Shapes.AddShape(Type:=msoShapeHeart, _

        Left:=100, Top:=100, Width:=100, Height:=100)

    Set effNew = sldFirst.TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect _

        (Shape:=shpHeart, EffectID:=msoAnimEffectChangeFillColor, _

        Trigger:=msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious)

    Set bhvEffect = effNew.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeFilter)

 

    With bhvEffect.FilterEffect

         .Type = msoAnimFilterEffectTypeWipe

         .Subtype = msoAnimFilterEffectSubtypeUp

         .Reveal = msoTrue

    End With

End Sub
```
