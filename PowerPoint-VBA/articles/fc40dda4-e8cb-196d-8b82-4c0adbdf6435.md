## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To take advantage of the collaboration features built into Microsoft PowerPoint, you must store presentations on a Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server.

For the  _VersionType_ parameter, you can also pass a constant from the ** [PpCheckInVersionType](c8500cce-1c18-2d61-ba25-09c4f83d0893.md)** enumeration.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example checks the server to see if the specified presentation can be checked in and, if so, closes the presentation and checks it back into server.


```
Sub CheckInPresentation(strPresentation As String)

    If Presentations(strPresentation).CanCheckIn = True Then

        Presentations(strPresentation).CheckIn

        MsgBox strPresentation &amp; " has been checked in."

    Else

        MsgBox strPresentation &amp; " cannot be checked in at this time.  Please try again later."

    End If

End Sub


```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the " _http://servername/workspace/report.ppt_" file name with an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```
Sub CheckInPresentation()

    Call CheckInPresentation(strPresentation:= "http://servername/workspace/report.ppt")

End Sub


```
