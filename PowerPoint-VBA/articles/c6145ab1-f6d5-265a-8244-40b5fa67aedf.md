## Example

This example verifies that a presentation is not checked out by another user and that it can be checked out. If the presentation can be checked out, it copies the presentation to the local computer for editing.


```vb
Sub CheckOutPresentation(strPresentation As String)

    Dim strFileName As String

    With Presentations
        If .CanCheckOut(strPresentation) = True Then
            .CheckOut FileName:=strPresentation
            .Open FileName:=strFileName
        Else
            MsgBox "You are unable to check out this " &; _
                "presentation at this time."
        End If
    End With
End Sub
```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the  _"http://servername/workspace/report.ppt"_ file name for an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```vb
Sub CheckPPTOut()
    Call CheckOutPresentation(strPresentation:= _
        "http://servername/workspace/report.doc")
End Sub
```
