# DropLines Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the drop lines in a chart group.

## Remarks

Drop lines connect the points in the chart with the x-axis. Only line and area chart groups can have drop lines. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single drop line; you either enable drop lines for all points in a chart group or you disable them.

If the  ** [HasDropLines](d957d6c6-acde-7ef0-9786-6f0f32d29253.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the  **DropLines** object are disabled.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

Use the  ** [DropLines](5646620d-e023-5953-4c91-34234de15b30.md)** property to return the **DropLines** object. The following example enables drop lines for chart group one of the first chart in the active document and then sets the drop line color to red.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        With .Chart.ChartGroups(1)

            .HasDropLines = True

            .DropLines.Border.ColorIndex = 3

        End With

    End If

End With
```
