| [Copy](41c82fd1-9ee7-c937-0a75-77b84c33c972.md)|Copies the specified object to the Clipboard.|
| [Cut](908c998d-a15f-5075-33e0-de6c124a0ec7.md)|Deletes the specified object and places it on the Clipboard.|
| [Delete](998a345f-31e3-1270-7826-17d84d60634b.md)|Deletes the specified  **Shape** object.|
| [Duplicate](0d2f22bc-ee72-6405-011a-77a9eb98fb39.md)|Creates a duplicate of the specified  **Shape** object, adds the new shape to the **Shapes** collection, and then returns a new **ShapeRange** object. The duplicated objects are placed at the end of the **Shapes** collection.|
| [Flip](f340183a-4ef6-1a17-bbbb-5b1ec2b9aa4e.md)|Flips the specified shape around its horizontal or vertical axis.|
| [IncrementLeft](a2b9a5e8-ba8c-612d-817f-c05d3df800b9.md)|Moves the specified shape horizontally by the specified number of points.|
| [IncrementRotation](f6e494fa-6bc1-0fc1-3bd3-ecc4fa5852e0.md)|Changes the rotation of the specified shape around the z-axis by the specified number of degrees. Use the  **Rotation**property to set the absolute rotation of the shape.|
| [IncrementTop](b74307f9-9efa-4117-9232-24dfd2bdb883.md)|Moves the specified shape vertically by the specified number of points.|
| [PickUp](35730a7e-3878-dfae-2aba-3395d41e5f3e.md)|Copies the formatting of the specified shape. Use the  **Apply**method to apply the copied formatting to another shape.|

| [RerouteConnections](0928190d-d184-7522-1ce2-0fa884950220.md)|Reroutes connectors so that they take the shortest possible path between the shapes they connect. To do this, the  **RerouteConnections** method may detach the ends of a connector and reattach them to different connecting sites on the connected shapes.|
| [ScaleHeight](0324449a-535c-e5ec-a9c3-0913f66057c0.md)|Scales the height of the shape by a specified factor.|
| [ScaleWidth](2fc35ce6-62f5-7fa5-582d-26df91656a50.md)|Scales the width of the shape by a specified factor. For pictures and OLE objects, you can indicate whether you want to scale the shape relative to the original size or relative to the current size. Shapes other than pictures and OLE objects are always scaled relative to their current width.|
| [Select](9fcf0ba4-ee6e-ecca-7948-7542db03ee99.md)|Selects the specified object.|
| [SetShapesDefaultProperties](4974cc1b-28af-94da-0821-76ffb698e2c3.md)|Applies the formatting for the specified shape to the default shape. Shapes created after this method has been used will have this formatting applied to them by default.|
| [Ungroup](2d0447df-7356-35e7-972e-e763ac1b3b8e.md)|Ungroups any grouped shapes in the specified shape or range of shapes. Disassembles pictures and OLE objects within the specified shape or range of shapes. Returns the ungrouped shapes as a single  ** [ShapeRange](0a194183-380e-ffb6-9336-b5bd311e917d.md)**object.|
| [UpgradeMedia](459ee25b-711f-2b74-38a0-3e209df7641b.md)|Converts a legacy media object to an updated media object.|
| [ZOrder](3317b5c3-611f-7cf8-3ce3-6d09255aa75f.md)|Moves the specified shape in front of or behind other shapes in the collection (that is, changes the shape's position in the z-order).|
