# PictureFormat Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains properties and methods that apply to pictures and OLE objects. 

## Example

Use the  **PictureFormat** property to return a **PictureFormat** object. The following example sets the brightness, contrast, and color transformation for shape one on `myDocument` and crops 18 points off the bottom of the shape. For this example to work, shape one must be either a picture or an OLE object.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(1).PictureFormat

    .Brightness = 0.3

    .Contrast = 0.7

    .ColorType = msoPictureGrayScale

    .CropBottom = 18

End With
```
