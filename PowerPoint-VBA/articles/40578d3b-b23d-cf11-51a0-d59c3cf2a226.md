# CalloutFormat.AutoLength Property (PowerPoint)

Determines whether the first segment of the callout retains the fixed length specified by the  **[Length](b0144e68-b495-0ef3-b228-599e56b7833e.md)** property, or is scaled automatically, whenever the callout is moved. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AutoLength**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **CalloutFormat** object.


### Return Value

MsoTriState


## Remarks

This property is read-only. However, you can use the  **[AutomaticLength](f80fdbbe-2fb4-c7d8-5f26-4edf16d65f82.md)** method to set this property to **msoTrue** and the **[CustomLength](0ee5196b-d3d4-ba8c-ff69-893a92a4ae4d.md)** method to set this property to **msoFalse**.

The value returned by the  **AutoLength** property can be one of these **MsoTriState** constants. This property applies only to callouts whose lines consist of more than one segment (types **msoCalloutThree** and **msoCalloutFour** ).



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**msoFalse**|The first segment of the callout retains the fixed length specified by the  **Length** property whenever the callout is moved.|
|**msoTrue**| The first segment of the callout line (the segment attached to the text callout box) is scaled automatically whenever the callout is moved.|

## Example

This example switches between an automatically scaling first segment and one with a fixed length for the callout line for shape one on  `myDocument`. For the example to work, shape one must be a callout.


```vb
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(1).Callout

    If .AutoLength Then

        .CustomLength 50

    Else

        .AutomaticLength

    End If

End With
```
