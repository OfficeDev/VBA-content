Dim customShowSlideIDs As Variant

Dim customShowToExpand As NamedSlideShow



customShowName = "Marketing Short Version"

Set customShowToExpand = ActivePresentation.SlideShowSettings _

    .NamedSlideShows(customShowName)

slideToAddID = ActiveWindow.View.Slide.SlideID

customShowSlideIDs = customShowToExpand.SlideIDs

numSlides = UBound(customShowSlideIDs)



ReDim Preserve customShowSlideIDs(numSlides + 1)



customShowSlideIDs(numSlides + 1) = slideToAddID

customShowToExpand.Delete

ActivePresentation.SlideShowSettings.NamedSlideShows _

    .Add customShowName, customShowSlideIDs
