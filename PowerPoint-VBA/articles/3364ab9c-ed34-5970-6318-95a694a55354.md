## Syntax

 _expression_. **ActivateChartDataWindow**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ChartData** object.

The  **ActivateChartDataWindow** method differs from the [ChartData.Activate](789651b8-334c-340a-e281-822f7129b76e.md) method in that the former opens the chart in an Excel window within Word, with the Excel ribbon unavailable, whereas the latter opens a full version of Excel, with the ribbon available.
