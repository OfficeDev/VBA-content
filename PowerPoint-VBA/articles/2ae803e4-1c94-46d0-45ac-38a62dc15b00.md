 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a command effect for an animation behavior. You can send events, call functions, and send OLE verbs to embedded objects using this object.

## Remarks

Use the  **CommandEffect** property of the ** [AnimationBehavior](70eeb4aa-b9ba-ff7d-93ee-425cf191a6cb.md)** object to return a **CommandEffect** object. Command effects can be changed using the **CommandEffect** object's **Command** and **Type** properties.


## Example

The following example shows how to set a command effect animation behavior.


```
Set bhvEffect = effectNew.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeCommand)

 

    With bhvEffect.CommandEffect

         .Type = msoAnimCommandTypeVerb

         .Command = Play

    End With


```
