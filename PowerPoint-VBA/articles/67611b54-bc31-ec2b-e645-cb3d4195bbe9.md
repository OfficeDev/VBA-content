If you use this property to return a path for a presentation that has not been saved, it returns an empty string.

The path doesn't include the final backslash (\) or the name of the specified object. Use the  **Name**property of the  **Presentation** object to return the file name without the path, and use the **FullName**property to return the file name and the path together.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example saves the active presentation in the same folder as PowerPoint. 


```
With Application

    fName = .Path &amp; "\test presentation"

    ActivePresentation.SaveAs fName

End With
```
