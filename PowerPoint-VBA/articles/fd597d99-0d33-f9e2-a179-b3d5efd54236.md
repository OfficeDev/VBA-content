# MotionEffect.ToX Property (PowerPoint)

Sets or returns a  **Single** that represents the horizontal position of a **[MotionEffect](77a34f68-8806-22b8-149f-c28e0457e7e9.md)** object, specified as a percent of the screen width. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ToX**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **MotionEffect** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks

The default value of this property is  **Empty**, in which case the current position of the object is used.

Use this property in conjunction with the  **FromX** property to resize or jump from one position to another.

Do not confuse this property with the  **To** property of the **[ColorEffect](c21ca9cd-3aaa-35f7-3d0e-89ca155322f2.md)**, **[RotationEffect](d0fc5520-dbbd-a44a-b811-51fd299c4587.md)**, or **[PropertyEffect](8fa129ac-f222-a01c-4545-0097b1164aee.md)** objects, which is used to set or change colors, rotations, or other properties of an animation behavior, respectively.


## Example

The following example adds an animation path and sets the starting and ending horizontal and vertical positions.


```vb
Sub AddMotionPath()

    Dim effCustom As Effect
    Dim animMotion As AnimationBehavior
    Dim shpRectangle As Shape

    'Adds shape and sets effect and animation properties
    Set shpRectangle = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes _
        .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, Left:=100, _

        Top:=100, Width:=50, Height:=50)

    Set effCustom = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence _
        .AddEffect(Shape:=shpRectangle, effectId:=msoAnimEffectCustom)

    Set animMotion = effCustom.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeMotion)

    'Sets starting and ending horizontal and vertical positions
    With animMotion.MotionEffect
        .FromX = 0
        .FromY = 0
        .ToX = 50
        .ToY = 50
    End With

End Sub
```
