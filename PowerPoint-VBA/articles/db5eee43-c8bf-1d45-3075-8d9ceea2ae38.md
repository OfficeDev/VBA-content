# GroupShapes Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the individual shapes within a grouped shape. Each shape is represented by a  ** [Shape](1da93849-99e0-827e-ced3-c6cf7f8569f3.md)**object. Using the  [Item](8cb574da-688e-5409-e638-41c7bb505558.md)method with this object, you can work with single shapes within a group without having to ungroup them.

## Example

Use the  [GroupItems](295499de-0e74-e4ad-1145-f21927cbf2a9.md)property to return the  **GroupShapes** collection. Use **GroupItems**(index), where index is the number of the individual shape within the grouped shape, to return a single shape from the  **GroupShapes** collection. The following example adds three triangles to `myDocument`, groups them, sets a color for the entire group, and then changes the color for the second triangle only.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes

    .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 10, _

        10, 100, 100).Name = "shpOne"

    .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 150, _

        10, 100, 100).Name = "shpTwo"

    .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 300, _

        10, 100, 100).Name = "shpThree"

    With .Range(Array("shpOne", "shpTwo", "shpThree")).Group

        .Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureBlueTissuePaper

        .GroupItems(2).Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureGreenMarble

    End With

End With
```
