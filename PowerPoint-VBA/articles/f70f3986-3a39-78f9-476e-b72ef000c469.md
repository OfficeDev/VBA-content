 [Example](#sectionSection2)

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Group**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ShapeRange** object.


### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single shape, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  ** [Shapes](eb208855-254e-1a0f-884b-4a5edcfd584d.md)** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example adds two shapes to  `myDocument`, groups the two new shapes, sets the fill for the group, rotates the group, and sends the group to the back of the drawing layer.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes

    .AddShape(msoShapeCan, 50, 10, 100, 200).Name = "shpOne"

    .AddShape(msoShapeCube, 150, 250, 100, 200).Name = "shpTwo"

    With .Range(Array("shpOne", "shpTwo")).Group

        .Fill.PresetTextured msoTextureBlueTissuePaper

        .Rotation = 45

        .ZOrder msoSendToBack

    End With

End With
```
