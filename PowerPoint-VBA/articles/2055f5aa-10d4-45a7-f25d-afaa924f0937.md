 _expression_. **RewindAtEnd**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Timing** object.


### Return Value

MsoTriState


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The value of the  **RewindAtEnd** property can be one of these **MsoTriState** constants.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **msoFalse**| The object does not return to its beginning position after an animation has ended.|
| **msoTrue**| The object returns to its beginning position after an animation has ended.|

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example adds a shape and an animation to the shape, then instructs the shape to return to its beginning position after the animation has ended.


```
Sub AddShapeSetTiming()

    Dim effDiamond As Effect

    Dim shpRectangle As Shape



    'Adds shape and sets animation effect

    Set shpRectangle = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes _

        .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, Left:=100, _

        Top:=100, Width:=50, Height:=50)

    Set effDiamond = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence _

        .AddEffect(Shape:=shpRectangle, effectId:=msoAnimEffectPathDiamond)



    'Sets duration of animation and returns shape to its original position

    With effDiamond.Timing

        .Duration = 3

        .RewindAtEnd = msoTrue

    End With



End Sub
```
