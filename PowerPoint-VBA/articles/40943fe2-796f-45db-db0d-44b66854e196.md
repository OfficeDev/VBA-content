 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Occurs before a presentation is saved.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **PresentationBeforeSave**( **_Pres_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Pres|Required| **Presentation**|The presentation being saved.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**| **True** to cancel the save process.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This event is triggered as the  **Save As** dialog box appears.

To access the  **Application** events, declare an **Application** variable in the General Declarations section of your code. Then set the variable equal to the **Application** object for which you want to access events. For information about using events with the Microsoft PowerPoint **Application** object, see [How to: Use Events with the Application Object](b657ab62-67fa-4eeb-736c-86e31a026c73.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example checks if there are revisions in a presentation and, if there are, asks whether to save the presentation. If a user's response is no, the save process is canceled. This example assumes an  **Application** object called PPTApp has been declared by using the **WithEvents** keyword.


```
Private Sub PPTApp_PresentationBeforeSave(ByVal Pres As Presentation, _

        Cancel As Boolean)

    Dim intResponse As Integer

    Set Pres = ActivePresentation

    If Pres.HasRevisionInfo Then

        intResponse = MsgBox(Prompt:="The presentation contains revisions. " &amp; _

            "Do you want to accept the revisions before saving?", Buttons:=vbYesNo)

        If intResponse = vbYes Then

            Cancel = True

            MsgBox "Your presentation was not saved."

        End If

    End If

End Sub


```
