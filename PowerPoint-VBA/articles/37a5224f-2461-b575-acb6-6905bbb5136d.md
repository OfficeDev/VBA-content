# Sequence Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a collection of  ** [Effect](359ac3da-86cd-8003-d691-349d20fd1777.md)**objects for a slide's interactive animation sequences. The  **Sequence** collection is a member of the ** [Sequences](7650703c-9072-6867-6367-4496b067aa8e.md)**collection.

## Example

Use the  [MainSequence](b71f83ad-6d92-cc10-9692-a7567ca0a077.md)property of the  ** [TimeLine](0b5a8863-8329-48d0-cb0b-3b34e87acb76.md)**object to return a  **Sequence** object.

Use the  [AddEffect](fea5ac1e-83ae-2241-bf3a-8cfdd8354791.md)method to add a new  **Sequence** object. This example adds a shape and an animation sequence to the first shape on the first slide in the active presentation.




```
Sub NewEffect()

    Dim effNew As Effect

    Dim shpFirst As Shape



    Set shpFirst = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1)

    Set effNew = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect _

        (Shape:=shpFirst, effectId:=msoAnimEffectBlinds)

End Sub
```
