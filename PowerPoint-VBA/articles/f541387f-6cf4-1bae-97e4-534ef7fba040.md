# Theme Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a theme (a collection of colors, fonts, and effects).

## Example

The following code example gets a reference to the currently active theme and then iterates over each theme variation in the theme.


```
Sub IterateThemeVariants()

    Dim pptTheme As Theme
    Dim pptThemeVariants As ThemeVariants
    Dim pptThemeVariant As ThemeVariant
    Dim path As String
    
    ' Get a reference to the currently active theme.
    path = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Document Themes 15\" &amp; _
        ActivePresentation.TemplateName &amp; ".thmx"
    Set pptTheme = Application.OpenThemeFile(path)
    
    ' Get a reference to all of the variations in the theme.
    Set pptThemeVariants = pptTheme.ThemeVariants
    
    ' Iterate over each variation of the theme and print
    ' its ID.
    For Each pptThemeVariant In pptThemeVariants
    
        Debug.Print "Variation id: " &amp; pptThemeVariant.Id
    
    Next pptThemeVariant

End Sub
```
