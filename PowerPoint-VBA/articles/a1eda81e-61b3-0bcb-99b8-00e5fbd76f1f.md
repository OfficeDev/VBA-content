# Set Control Properties

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can set some control properties at design time (before any macro is running). In design mode, right-click a control and click  **Properties** to display the Properties window. Property names are shown in the left column in the window, property values in the right column. You set a property value by entering the new value to the right of the property name.
