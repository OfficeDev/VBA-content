# Comment Object (PowerPoint)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a comment on a given slide or slide range. The  **Comment** object is a member of the ** [Comments](1f29db7c-90fa-db9f-5229-136534ce803d.md)**collection object.

## Remarks

Use the following properties to access comment data:



| [Author](83feff12-02a1-444e-baaf-15e39049e6a5.md)|The author's full name|
| [AuthorIndex](a004167b-a564-651e-1769-9e1a8947e385.md)|The author's index in the list of comments|
| [AuthorInitials](21789206-78b0-2c9e-4461-5005d821bd6c.md)|The author's initials|
| [DateTime](52e08d04-18d6-61fc-1526-ef669aa5f6c8.md)|The date and time the comment was created|
| [Text](98d33fc2-a30b-61b9-65b8-5859925faf8f.md)|The text of the comment|
| [Left](29da86cf-2216-021a-d5d1-32995b8742fd.md),  [Top](07b292ef-a329-64d6-060a-5ce3718b96d4.md)|The comment's screen coordinates|

## Example

Use  ** [Comments](396c2d6b-f0cb-3ed8-94ae-6ee864d194c1.md)**(index), where index is the number of the comment, or the  ** [Item](d60f4227-87ea-7d48-f8cb-0cf85dfe3a97.md)**method to access a single comment on a slide. This example displays the author of the first comment on the first slide. If there are no comments, it displays a message stating such.


```
Sub ShowComment()

    With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Comments

        If .Count > 0 Then

            MsgBox "The first comment on this slide is by " &amp; .Item(1).Author

        Else

            MsgBox "There are no comments on this slide."

        End If

    End With

End Sub
```

This example displays a message containing the author, date and time, and contents of all the messages on the first slide.




```
Sub SlideComments()

    Dim cmtExisting As Comment

    Dim cmtAll As Comments

    Dim strComments As String



    Set cmtAll = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Comments



    If cmtAll.Count > 0 Then

        For Each cmtExisting In cmtAll

            strComments = strComments &amp; cmtExisting.Author &amp; vbTab &amp; _

                cmtExisting.DateTime &amp; vbTab &amp; cmtExisting.Text &amp; vbLf

        Next

        MsgBox "The comments in your document are as follows:" &amp; vbLf &amp; strComments

    Else

        MsgBox "This slide doesn't have any comments."

    End If

End Sub
```
