 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example sets the chart elevation of the first chart in the active document to 34 degrees. You should run the example on a 3-D chart.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.Elevation = 34

    End If

End With
```
