# Report.Resize Event (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **Resize** event occurs when a report is opened and whenever the size of a report changes.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Resize**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.


## Remarks

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  ** [OnResize](84e6df44-53d2-19c9-e8c5-47681649c7e8.md)** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

This event occurs if you change the size of the report in a macro or event procedureâ€”for example, if you use the MoveSize action in a macro to resize the report.

By running a macro or an event procedure when a  **Resize** event occurs, you can move or resize a control when the report it's on is resized. You can also use a **Resize** event to recalculate variables or reset properties that may depend on the size of the report.

When you first open a report, the following events occur in this order:

Open â†’ Load â†’ Resize â†’ Activate â†’ Current


 **Note**  You need to be careful if you use a  **MoveSize**,  **Maximize**,  **Minimize**, or  **Restore** action (or the corresponding methods of the **DoCmd** object) in a **Resize** macro or event procedure. These actions can trigger a **Resize** event for the report, and thus cause a cascading event.
