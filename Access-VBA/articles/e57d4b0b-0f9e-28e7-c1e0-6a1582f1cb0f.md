## Syntax

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **TabControl** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  Setting the value of a control by using a macro or Visual Basic doesn't trigger this event for the control. You must type the data directly into the control, or set the control's  **Text** property.

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnChange** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

By running a macro or event procedure when a Change event occurs, you can coordinate data display among controls. You can also display data or a formula in one control and the results in another control.
