# Reference Object (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **Reference** object refers to a reference set to another application's or project's type library.

## Remarks

When you create a  **Reference** object, you set a reference dynamically from Visual Basic.

The  **Reference** object is a member of the **References** collection. To refer to a particular **Reference** object in the **References** collection, use any of the following syntax forms.



|**Syntax**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **References**!referencename|The referencename argument is the name of the **Reference** object.|
| **References**("referencename")|The referencename argument is the name of the **Reference** object.|
| **References**(index)|The index argument is the object's numerical position within the collection.|

 **Note**  The following example refers to the  **Reference** object that represents the reference to the Microsoft Access type library:




```
Dim ref As Reference 
Set ref = References!Access
```
