# PivotTable.SortUsingCustomLists Property (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **SortUsingCustomLists** property controls whether custom lists are used for sorting items of fields, both initially when the PivotField is initialized and the PivotItems are ordered by their captions; and later when the user applies a sort. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SortUsingCustomLists**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotTable** object.


## Remarks

Setting this property to  **False** can optimize performance for fields with many items, and it also allows users who do not want custom list-based sorting to avoid it.
