You can use the  **ViewsAllowed** property to specify whether users can switch between Datasheet view and Form view by clicking the **Form View** or **Datasheet View** command on the **View** menu or by clicking the arrow next to the **View** button and clicking **Form View** or **Datasheet View**. Read/write  **Byte**.

The  **ViewsAllowed** property uses the following settings.

|:-----|:-----|
|0|(Default) Users can switch between Form view and Datasheet view.|
|1|Users can't switch to Datasheet view from Form view.|
|2|Users can't switch to Form view from Datasheet view.|

The combination of these properties creates the following conditions.
