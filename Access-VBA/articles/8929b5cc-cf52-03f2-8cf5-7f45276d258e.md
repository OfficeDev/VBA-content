# Relations Collection (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **Relations** collection contains stored **Relation** objects of a **Database** object (Microsoft Access database engine databases only).


## Remarks

You can use the  **Relation** object to create new relationships and examine existing relationships in your database. To add a **Relation** object to the **Relations** collection, first create it with the **CreateRelation** method, and then append it to the **Relations** collection with the **Append** method. This will save the **Relation** object when you close the **Database** object. To remove a **Relation** object from the collection, use the **Delete** method.

To refer to a  **Relation** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:

 **Relations** (0)

 **Relations** (" _name_")

 **Relations** ![ _name_]


## Example

This example shows how an existing  **Relation** object can control data entry. The procedure attempts to add a record with a deliberately incorrect CategoryID; this triggers the error-handling routine.


```vb
Sub RelationX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstProducts As Recordset 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 Dim fldLoop As Field 
 Dim errLoop As Error 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstProducts = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Products") 
 
 ' Print a report showing all the different parts of 
 ' the relation and where each part is stored. 
 With dbsNorthwind.Relations!CategoriesProducts 
 Debug.Print "Properties of " &; .Name &; " Relation" 
 Debug.Print " Table = " &; .Table 
 Debug.Print " ForeignTable = " &; .ForeignTable 
 Debug.Print "Fields of " &; .Name &; " Relation" 
 With .Fields!CategoryID 
 Debug.Print " " &; .Name 
 Debug.Print " Name = " &; .Name 
 Debug.Print " ForeignName = " &; .ForeignName 
 End With 
 End With 
 
 ' Attempt to add a record that violates the relation. 
 With rstProducts 
 .AddNew 
 !ProductName = "Trygve's Lutefisk" 
 !CategoryID = 10 
 On Error GoTo Err_Relation 
 .Update 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
 Exit Sub 
 
Err_Relation: 
 
 ' Notify user of any errors that result from 
 ' the invalid data. 
 If DBEngine.Errors.Count > 0 Then 
 For Each errLoop In DBEngine.Errors 
 MsgBox "Error number: " &; errLoop.Number &; _ 
 vbCr &; errLoop.Description 
 Next errLoop 
 End If 
 
 Resume Next 
 
End Sub
```

This example uses the  **CreateRelation** method to create a **Relation** between the Employees **TableDef** and a new **TableDef** called Departments. This example also demonstrates how creating a new **Relation** will also create any necessary **Indexes** in the foreign table (the DepartmentsEmployees Index in the Employees table).




```vb
Sub CreateRelationX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim tdfEmployees As TableDef 
 Dim tdfNew As TableDef 
 Dim idxNew As Index 
 Dim relNew As Relation 
 Dim idxLoop As Index 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 With dbsNorthwind 
 ' Add new field to Employees table. 
 Set tdfEmployees = .TableDefs!Employees 
 tdfEmployees.Fields.Append _ 
 tdfEmployees.CreateField("DeptID", dbInteger, 2) 
 
 ' Create new Departments table. 
 Set tdfNew = .CreateTableDef("Departments") 
 
 With tdfNew 
 ' Create and append Field objects to Fields 
 ' collection of the new TableDef object. 
 .Fields.Append .CreateField("DeptID", dbInteger, 2) 
 .Fields.Append .CreateField("DeptName", dbText, 20) 
 
 ' Create Index object for Departments table. 
 Set idxNew = .CreateIndex("DeptIDIndex") 
 ' Create and append Field object to Fields 
 ' collection of the new Index object. 
 idxNew.Fields.Append idxNew.CreateField("DeptID") 
 ' The index in the primary table must be Unique in 
 ' order to be part of a Relation. 
 idxNew.Unique = True 
 .Indexes.Append idxNew 
 End With 
 
 .TableDefs.Append tdfNew 
 
 ' Create EmployeesDepartments Relation object, using 
 ' the names of the two tables in the relation. 
 Set relNew = .CreateRelation("EmployeesDepartments", _ 
 tdfNew.Name, tdfEmployees.Name, _ 
 dbRelationUpdateCascade) 
 
 ' Create Field object for the Fields collection of the 
 ' new Relation object. Set the Name and ForeignName 
 ' properties based on the fields to be used for the 
 ' relation. 
 relNew.Fields.Append relNew.CreateField("DeptID") 
 relNew.Fields!DeptID.ForeignName = "DeptID" 
 .Relations.Append relNew 
 
 ' Print report. 
 Debug.Print "Properties of " &; relNew.Name &; _ 
 " Relation" 
 Debug.Print " Table = " &; relNew.Table 
 Debug.Print " ForeignTable = " &; _ 
 relNew.ForeignTable 
 Debug.Print "Fields of " &; relNew.Name &; " Relation" 
 
 With relNew.Fields!DeptID 
 Debug.Print " " &; .Name 
 Debug.Print " Name = " &; .Name 
 Debug.Print " ForeignName = " &; .ForeignName 
 End With 
 
 Debug.Print "Indexes in " &; tdfEmployees.Name &; _ 
 " TableDef" 
 For Each idxLoop In tdfEmployees.Indexes 
 Debug.Print " " &; idxLoop.Name &; _ 
 ", Foreign = " &; idxLoop.Foreign 
 Next idxLoop 
 
 ' Delete new objects because this is a demonstration. 
 .Relations.Delete relNew.Name 
 .TableDefs.Delete tdfNew.Name 
 tdfEmployees.Fields.Delete "DeptID" 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
