Estimates the variance across a sample in a specified set of records (a domain).


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **DVar**( **_Expr_**,  **_Domain_**,  **_Criteria_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Expr|Required| **String**|An expression that identifies the numeric field on which you want to find the variance. It can be a string expression identifying a field from a table or query, or it can be an expression that performs a  [calculation on data in that field](73c27d1c-0a3c-03e4-c17c-337133d7b316.md) . Inexpr, you can include the name field in a table, a control on a form, a constant, or a function. If expr includes a function, it can be either built-in or user-defined, but not another domain aggregate or SQL aggregate function. Any field included inexpr must be a numeric field.|
|Domain|Required| **String**|A string expression identifying the set of records that constitutes the domain. It can be a table name or a query name for a query that does not require a parameter.|
|Criteria|Optional| **Variant**|An optional string expression used to restrict the range of data on which the  **DVar** function is performed. For example,criteria is often equivalent to the WHERE clause in an SQL expression, without the word WHERE. Ifcriteria is omitted, the **DVar** function evaluatesexpr against the entire domain. Any field that is included incriteria must also be a field indomain; otherwise the  **DVar** function returns a **Null**.|

### Return Value

Variant


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For example, you could use the  **DVar** function to calculate the variance across a set of students' test scores.

If domain refers to fewer than two records or if fewer than two records satisfycriteria, the  **DVar** functions return a **Null**, indicating that a variance can't be calculated.

Whether you use the  **DVar** function in a macro, module, query expression, or calculated control, you must construct thecriteria argument carefully to ensure that it will be evaluated correctly.

You can use the  **DVar** function to specify criteria in the **Criteria** row of a select query, in a calculated field expression in a query, or in the **Update To** row of an update query.


 **Note**  You can use the  **DVar** function or the **Var** function in a calculated field expression in a totals query. If you use the **DVar** function, values are calculated before data is grouped. If you use the **Var** function, the data is grouped before values in the field expression are evaluated.

Use the  **DVar** function in a calculated control when you need to specifycriteria to restrict the range of data on which the function is performed. For example, to display a variance for orders to be shipped to California, set the **ControlSource** property of a text box to the following expression:




```
=DVar("[Freight]", "Orders", "[ShipRegion] = 'CA'")
```

If you simply want to find the standard deviation across all records in domain, use the  **Var** or **VarP** function.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example returns estimates of the variance for a population and a population sample for orders shipped to the United Kingdom. The domain is an Orders table. The criteria argument restricts the resulting set of records to those for which ShipCountry equals UK.


```
Dim dblX As Double 
Dim dblY As Double 
 
' Sample estimate. 
dblX = DVar("[Freight]", "Orders", "[ShipCountry] = 'UK'") 
 
' Population estimate. 
dblY = DVarP("[Freight]", "Orders", "[ShipCountry] = 'UK'")
```

The next example returns estimates by using a variable,  `strCountry`, in the criteria argument. Note that single quotation marks (') are included in the string expression, so that when the strings are concatenated, the string literal `UK` will be enclosed in single quotation marks.




```
Dim strCountry As String| 
Dim dblX As Double 
 
strCountry = "UK" 
 
dblX = DVar("[Freight]", "Orders", "[ShipCountry] = '" _ 
    &amp; strCountry &amp; "'")
```



The following examples show how to use various types of criteria with the  **DVar** function.
