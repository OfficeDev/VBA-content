# DoCmd.Echo Method (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Carries out the Echo action in Visual Basic.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Echo**( **_EchoOn_**,  **_StatusBarText_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DoCmd** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|EchoOn|Required| **Variant**|Use  **True** to turn echo on and **False** to turn it off.|
|StatusBarText|Optional| **Variant**|A string expression indicating the text that appears in the status bar.|

## Remarks

If you leave the StatusBarText argument blank, do not use a comma following theechoon argument.

If you turn echo off in Visual Basic, you must turn it back on or it will remain off, even if the user presses CTRL+BREAK or if Visual Basic encounters a breakpoint. You may want to create a macro that turns echo on and then assign that macro to a key combination or a custom menu command. You could then use the key combination or menu command to turn echo on if it has been turned off in Visual Basic.

The  **Echo** method of the **DoCmd** object was added to provide backward compatibility for running the Echo action in Visual Basic code in Microsoft Access for Windows 95. It is recommended that you use the existing **Echo** method of the **Application**object instead.


 **Note**  The  **Echo** method does not affect the visibility of the ribbon or the availability of ribbon commands.
