 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **OldValue** property to determine the unedited value of a bound control. Read-only **Variant**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **OldValue**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Attachment** object.


## Remarks

The  **OldValue** property contains the unedited data from a bound control and is read-only in all views.

Microsoft Access uses the  **OldValue** property to store the original value of a bound control. When you edit a bound control on a form, your changes aren't saved until you move to another record. The **OldValue** property contains the unedited version of the underlying data.

You can provide your own undo capability by assigning the  **OldValue** property setting to a control.

If the control hasn't been edited, this code has no effect. When you move to another record, the record source is updated, so the current value and the  **OldValue** property will be the same.

The  **OldValue** property setting has the same data type as the field to which the control is bound.
