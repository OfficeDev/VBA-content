Gets or sets the shade that is applied to the theme color in the  **ForeColor** property of the specified object. Read/write **Single**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ForeShade**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **TextBox** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **ForeShade** property contains a numeric expression that can be used to darken the theme color in the **BackColor** property. The default value of the **ForeShade** property is 100, which is neutral, and does not change the theme color. To darken the color you first determine the percentage by which to darken from 1 to 100, then subtract that value as a whole number from 100 and use the remainder. For example, to darken the theme color by 75%, you subtract 75 from 100 and use the remainder, which is 25.

This property is not surfaced in the property sheet.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code darkens  **ForeColor** by 75%.


```
Me.ctl.ForeShade=25
```
