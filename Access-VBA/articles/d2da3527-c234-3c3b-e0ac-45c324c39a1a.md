## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Properties**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CustomControl** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **Properties** collection object is the collection of all the properties related to a control. You can refer to individual members of the collection by using the member object's index or a string expression that is the name of the member object. The first member object in the collection has an index value of 0 and the total number of member objects in the collection is the value of the **Properties** collection's **Count**property minus 1.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following procedure uses the  **Properties** property to print all the properties associated with the controls on a form to the Debug window. To run this code, place a command button named cmdListProperties on a form and paste the following code into the form's Declarations section. Click the command button to print the list of properties in the Debug window.


```
Private Sub cmdListProperties_Click() 
 ListControlProps Me 
End Sub 
 
Public Sub ListControlProps(ByRef frm As Form) 
 Dim ctl As Control 
 Dim prp As Property 
 
 On Error GoTo props_err 
 
 For Each ctl In frm.Controls 
 Debug.Print ctl.Properties("Name") 
 For Each prp In ctl.Properties 
 Debug.Print vbTab &amp; prp.Name &amp; " = " &amp; prp.Value 
 Next prp 
 Next ctl 
 
props_exit: 
 Set ctl = Nothing 
 Set prp = Nothing 
Exit Sub 
 
props_err: 
 If Err = 2187 Then 
 Debug.Print vbTab &amp; prp.Name &amp; " = Only available at design time." 
 Resume Next 
 Else 
 Debug.Print vbTab &amp; prp.Name &amp; " = Error Occurred: " &amp; Err.Description 
 Resume Next 
 End If 
End Sub
```
