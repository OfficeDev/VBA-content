
# Cannot make a new replica because the <name> object in <name> container could not be made replicable. (Error 3582)

The database could not be made replicable because the specified object could not be replicated. For example, if the maximum number of allowed indexes is exceeded on a table, the table cannot be replicated. To prevent this error, prior to making the database replicable ensure that the objects in the database adhere to replication requirements.
