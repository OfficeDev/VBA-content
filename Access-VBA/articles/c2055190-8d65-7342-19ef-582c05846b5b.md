To specify numeric criteria for an operation, you supply a numeric value as part of the string expression that forms the  _criteria_ argument.

Suppose that you are performing the  ** [DLookup](CBE1FC56-E4D7-CB74-02DF-48FC379CF432.md)** function on an Employees table to find the last name of a particular employee, and you want to use a value from the EmployeeID field in the function's _criteria_ argument. You could construct a _criteria_ argument like the following example, which returns the last name of the employee whose EmployeeID is 7:



```
=DLookup("[LastName]", "Employees", "[EmployeeID] = 7")
```
