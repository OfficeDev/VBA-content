 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Attachment** object.


### Parameters

## Remarks

Examples of this event include entering a character directly in the text box or combo box or changing the control's  **Text**property setting by using a macro or Visual Basic.


- Modifying a record within a form by using a macro or Visual Basic doesn't trigger this event. You must type the data directly into the record or set the control's  **Text** property.
    
- This event applies only to bound forms, not an unbound form or report.
    
To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnDirty**property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

Canceling the  **Dirty** event will cause the changes to the current record to be rolled back. It is equivalent to pressing the ESC key.
