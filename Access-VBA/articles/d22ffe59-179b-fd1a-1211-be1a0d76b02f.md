## Step 3: Send the Data

Now that you have a  **Recordset**, you need to send it to the client by saving it as XML to the ASP **Response** object. Add the following code to the bottom of XMLResponse.asp:


```vb
 
  Response.ContentType = "text/xml" 
  Response.Expires = 0 
  Response.Buffer = False 
 
 
  Response.Write "<?xml version='1.0'?>" &; vbNewLine 
  adoRec.save Response, adPersistXML 
  adoRec.Close 
  Set adoRec=Nothing 
%> 

```

Notice that the ASP  **Response** object is specified as the destination for the **Recordset**[Save](02dab13b-f947-b96d-46ea-0def3ed8f28f.md) method. The destination of the **Save** method can be any object that supports the **IStream** interface, such as an ADO[Stream](d49b1514-e0b4-0aca-d5c2-8266f3f4fe65.md) object, or a file name that includes the complete path to which the **Recordset** is to be saved.

Save and close XMLResponse.asp before going to the next step. Also copy the adovbs.inc file from C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Ado folder to the same folder where you have the XMLResponse.asp file.
