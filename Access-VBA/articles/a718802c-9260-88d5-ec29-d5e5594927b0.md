# PROCEDURE Clause (Microsoft Access SQL)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

 **In this article**
[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[ Example](#sectionSection2)


Defines a name and optional parameters for a query.

 **Note**  The PROCEDURE clause has been superseded by the PROCEDURE statement. Although the PROCEDURE clause is still supported, the PROCEDURE statement provides a superset of the capability of the PROCEDURE clause and is the recommended syntax.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

PROCEDURE  _name_ [ _param1 datatype_ [, _param2 datatype_ [, …]]

The PROCEDURE clause has these parts:



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _name_|A name for the procedure. It must follow standard naming conventions.|
| _param1_, _param2_|One or more field names or parameters. For example:
```sql
PROCEDURE Sales_By_Country [Beginning Date] DateTime, [Ending Date] DateTime;
```

For more information on parameters, see [parameters](0dcaad68-6a5f-93dc-e62a-b82b36e1e69c.md).|
| _datatype_|One of the primary [Microsoft Access SQL data types](4fc2dc8c-7825-8fbb-ff91-a0f39ef90115.md) or their synonyms.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

An SQL procedure consists of a PROCEDURE clause (which specifies the name of the procedure), an optional list of parameter definitions, and a single SQL statement. For example, the procedure Get_Part_Number might run a query that retrieves a specified part number.


 **Note**  


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example names the query CategoryList.

This example calls the EnumFields procedure, which you can find in the SELECT statement example.




```vb
Sub ProcedureX() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset 
    Dim qdf As QueryDef, strSql As String 
     
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
    strSql = "PROCEDURE CategoryList; " _ 
        &; "SELECT DISTINCTROW CategoryName, " _ 
        &; "CategoryID FROM Categories " _ 
        &; "ORDER BY CategoryName;" 
     
    ' Create a named QueryDef based on the SQL 
    ' statement. 
    Set qdf = dbs.CreateQueryDef("NewQry", strSql) 
 
    ' Create a temporary snapshot-type Recordset. 
    Set rst = qdf.OpenRecordset(dbOpenSnapshot) 
 
    ' Populate the Recordset. 
    rst.MoveLast 
             
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the  
    ' Recordset. Pass the Recordset object and desired 
    ' field width. 
    EnumFields rst, 15 
     
    ' Delete the QueryDef because this is a 
    ' demonstration. 
    dbs.QueryDefs.Delete "NewQry" 
     
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
