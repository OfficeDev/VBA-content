 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WorksheetFunction** object.

|Arg3|Required| **Double**|Num_chars - the number of characters in old_text that you want REPLACE to replace with new_text.|
|Arg4|Required| **String**|New_text - the text that will replace characters in old_text.|

### Return Value

## Remarks


 **Important**  REPLACE is intended for use with languages that use the single-byte character set (SBCS), whereas REPLACEB is intended for use with languages that use the double-byte character set (DBCS). The default language setting on your computer affects the return value in the following way:


- REPLACE always counts each character, whether single-byte or double-byte, as 1, no matter what the default language setting is.
    
-  REPLACEB counts each double-byte character as 2 when you have enabled the editing of a language that supports DBCS and then set it as the default language. Otherwise, REPLACEB counts each character as 1.
    
The languages that support DBCS include Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Korean.
