# ComboBox.Value Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Determines or specifies which value or option in the combo box is selected. Read/write  **Variant**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Value**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The  **Value** property is set to the text in the text box portion of the control. This may or may not be the same as the setting for the **Text**property of the control. The current setting for the  **Text** property is what is displayed in the text box portion of the combo box; the **Value** property is set to the **Text** property setting only after this text is saved.

The  **Value** property returns or sets a control's default property, which is the property that is assumed when you don't explicitly specify a property name.


 **Note**   The **Value** property is not the same as the **DefaultValue**property, which specifies the value that a property is assigned when a new record is created.
