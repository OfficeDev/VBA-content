Returns the number of bytes used in the database (rather than in memory) of a Memo or Long Binary  **Field2** object in the **[Fields](4be3ba07-20c1-d958-c1b8-7dd8b4731f60.md)** collection of a **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **FieldSize**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Field2** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use  **FieldSize** with the **[AppendChunk](f98c6862-fecf-06cb-a7c0-42b0d3150a06.md)** and **[GetChunk](b8984e79-54f7-8052-85a3-d12033daf7a1.md)** methods to manipulate large fields.

Because the size of a Long Binary or Memo field can exceed 64K, you should assign the value returned by  **FieldSize** to a variable large enough to store a **Long** variable.

To determine the size of a  **Field2** object other than Memo and Long Binary types, use the **[Size](15e25201-87b6-f62f-ff18-259414a47891.md)** property.




- If the database server or ODBC driver does not support server-side cursors.
    
- If you are using the ODBC cursor library (that is, the  **DefaultCursorDriver** property is set to **dbUseODBC**, or to **dbUseDefault** when the server does not support server-side cursors).
    
- If you are using a cursorless query (that is, the  **DefaultCursorDriver** property is set to **dbUseNoCursor** ).
    


The  **FieldSize** property and the VBA **Len()** or **LenB()** functions may return different values as the length of the same string. Strings are stored in a Microsoft Access database in multi-byte character set (MBCS) form, but exposed through VBA in Unicode format. As a result, the **Len()** function will always return the number of characters, **LenB** will always return the number of characters X 2 (Unicode uses two bytes for each character), but **FieldSize** will return some value in between if the string has any MBCS characters. For example, given a string consisting of three normal characters and two MBCS characters, **Len()** will return 5, **LenB()** will return 10, and **FieldSize** will return 7, the sum of 1 for each normal character and 2 for each MBCS character.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **FieldSize** property to list the number of bytes used by the Memo and Long Binary Field objects in two different tables.


```vb
Sub FieldSizeX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstCategories As Recordset 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstCategories = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Categories", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "Field sizes from records in Categories table" 
 
 With rstCategories 
 Debug.Print " CategoryName - " &; _ 
 "Description (bytes) - Picture (bytes)" 
 
 ' Enumerate the Categories Recordset and print the size 
 ' in bytes of the picture field for each record. 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 Debug.Print " " &; !CategoryName &; " - " &; _ 
 !Description.FieldSize &; " - " &; _ 
 !Picture.FieldSize 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 Debug.Print "Field sizes from records in Employees table" 
 
 With rstEmployees 
 Debug.Print " LastName - Notes (bytes) - " &; _ 
 "Photo (bytes)" 
 
 ' Enumerate the Employees Recordset and print the size 
 ' in bytes of the picture field for each record. 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 Debug.Print " " &; !LastName &; " - " &; _ 
 !Notes.FieldSize &; " - " &; !Photo.FieldSize 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub
```

This example uses the  **AppendChunk** and **GetChunk** methods to fill an OLE object field with data from another record, 32K at a time. In a real application, one might use a procedure like this to copy an employee record (including the employee's photo) from one table to another. In this example, the record is simply being copied back to same table. Note that all the chunk manipulation takes place within a single AddNew-Update sequence.




```vb
Sub AppendChunkX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim rstEmployees2 As Recordset 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 ' Open two recordsets from the Employees table. 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 Set rstEmployees2 = rstEmployees.Clone 
 
 ' Add a new record to the first Recordset and copy the 
 ' data from a record in the second Recordset. 
 With rstEmployees 
 .AddNew 
 !FirstName = rstEmployees2!FirstName 
 !LastName = rstEmployees2!LastName 
 CopyLargeField rstEmployees2!Photo, !Photo 
 .Update 
 
 ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
 .Bookmark = .LastModified 
 .Delete 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 rstEmployees2.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Function CopyLargeField(fldSource As Field2, _ 
 fldDestination As Field2) 
 
 ' Set size of chunk in bytes. 
 Const conChunkSize = 32768 
 
 Dim lngOffset As Long 
 Dim lngTotalSize As Long 
 Dim strChunk As String 
 
 ' Copy the photo from one Recordset to the other in 32K 
 ' chunks until the entire field is copied. 
 lngTotalSize = fldSource.FieldSize 
 Do While lngOffset < lngTotalSize 
 strChunk = fldSource.GetChunk(lngOffset, conChunkSize) 
 fldDestination.AppendChunk strChunk 
 lngOffset = lngOffset + conChunkSize 
 Loop 
 
End Function
```
