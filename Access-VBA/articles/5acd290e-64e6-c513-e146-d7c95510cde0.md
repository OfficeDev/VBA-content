
# Rectangle Control

The rectangle control displays a rectangle on a form or report.


## Remarks

You can move a rectangle and the controls in it as a single unit by dragging the mouse pointer diagonally across the entire rectangle to select all of the controls. The entire selection can then be moved to a new position.
