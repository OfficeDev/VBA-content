|Continuous Forms|1|Displays multiple records (as many as will fit in the current window), each in its own copy of the form's detail section.|
|Datasheet|2|Displays the form fields arranged in rows and columns like a spreadsheet.|
|PivotTable|3|Displays the form as a PivotTable.|
|PivotChart|4|Displays the form as a PivotChart.|
|Split Form|5|Displayes a split view of a Single Form and a datasheet containing the form's records.|
The views displayed in the  **View** button list depend on the setting of the **ViewsAllowed** property. For example, if the **ViewsAllowed** property is set to Datasheet, Form View is disabled in the View button list and on the View menu.

The combination of these properties creates the following conditions.
