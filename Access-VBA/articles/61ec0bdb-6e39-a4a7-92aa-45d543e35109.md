### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Button|Required| **Integer**|The button that was pressed or released when the event was triggered. If you need to test for the Button argument, you can use one of the following intrinsic constants as bit masks:
<ul xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p><b>acLeftButton</b> The bit mask for the left mouse button.  
  </p></li><li><p><b>acRightButton</b> The bit mask for the right mouse button.</p></li><li><p><b>acMiddleButton</b> The bit mask for the middle mouse button.  
</p></li></ul>|
|Shift|Required| **Integer**|The state of the SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT keys when the button specified by the Button argument was pressed or released. If you need to test for the Shift argument, you can use one of the following intrinsic constants as bit masks:
<ul xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p><b>acShiftMask</b> The bit mask for the SHIFT key.  
  </p></li><li><p><b>acCtrlMask</b> The bit mask for the CTRL key.</p></li><li><p><b>acAltMask</b> The bit mask for the ALT key.  
  
 </p></li></ul>|
|X|Required| **Single**|The x coordinate for the current location of the mouse pointer, in twips. |
|Y|Required| **Single**|The y coordinate for the current location of the mouse pointer, in twips. |

## Remarks




- The  **MouseMove** event applies only to forms, form sections, and controls on a form, not controls on a report.
    
- This event does not apply to a label attached to another control, such as the label for a text box. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Pressing and releasing a mouse button in an attached label has the same effect as pressing and releasing the button in the associated control. The normal events for the control occur; no separate events occur for the attached label.
    


To run a macro or event procedure when these events occur, set the  **OnMouseMove** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

The  **MouseMove** event is generated continually as the mouse pointer moves over objects. Unless another object generates a mouse event, an object recognizes a **MouseMove** event whenever the mouse pointer is positioned within its borders.

To cause a  **MouseMove** event for a form to occur, move the mouse pointer over a blank area, record selector, or scroll bar on the form. To cause a **MouseMove** event for a form section to occur, move the mouse pointer over a blank area of the form section.

To respond to an event caused by moving the mouse, you use a  **MouseMove** event.


 **Note**  

To run a macro or event procedure in response to pressing and releasing the mouse buttons, you use the  **MouseDown** and **MouseUp** events.
