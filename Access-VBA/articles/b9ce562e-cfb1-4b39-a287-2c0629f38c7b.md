You can use the  **VBE** property to return a reference to the current **VBE** object and its related properties. The **VBE** property of the **[Application](aefb0713-97e6-e2c7-e530-8fd2e1316a55.md)** object represents the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications editor. Read-only **VBE** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **VBE**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


## Remarks

Once you establish a reference to the  **VBE** object, you can access all the properties and methods of the object. You can set a reference to the **VBE** object by clicking **References** on the **Tools** menu while in module Design view. Then set a reference to the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3 Object Library in the **References** dialog box by selecting the appropriate check box. Microsoft Access can set this reference for you if you use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3 Object Library constant to set a **VBE** object's property or as an argument to a **VBE** object's method.


## Example
