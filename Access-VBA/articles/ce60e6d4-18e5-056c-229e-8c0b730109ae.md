 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Selects any range or Visual Basic procedure in any workbook, and activates that workbook if it's not already active.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Goto**( **_Reference_**,  **_Scroll_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Reference|Optional| **Variant**|The destination. Can be a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object, a string that contains a cell reference in R1C1-style notation, or a string that contains a Visual Basic procedure name. If this argument is omitted, the destination is the last range you used the **Goto** method to select.|
|Scroll|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to scroll through the window so that the upper-left corner of the range appears in the upper-left corner of the window. **False** to not scroll through the window. The default is **False**.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This method differs from the  ** [Select](46c12f85-fae5-15ea-3500-81ff8be49cdb.md)**method in the following ways:


- If you specify a range on a sheet that's not on top, Microsoft Excel will switch to that sheet before selecting. (If you use  **Select** with a range on a sheet that's not on top, the range will be selected but the sheet won't be activated).
    
- This method has a  **_Scroll_** argument that lets you scroll through the destination window.
    
- When you use the  **Goto** method, the previous selection (before the **Goto** method runs) is added to the array of previous selections (for more information, see the ** [PreviousSelections](967ba122-700c-dca5-1b95-aeaf59e9f19c.md)**property). You can use this feature to quickly jump between as many as four selections.
    
- The  **Select** method has aReplace argument; the **Goto** method doesn't.
    

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example selects cell A154 on Sheet1 and then scrolls through the worksheet to display the range.


```
Application.Goto Reference:=Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A154"), _ 
 scroll:=True
```
