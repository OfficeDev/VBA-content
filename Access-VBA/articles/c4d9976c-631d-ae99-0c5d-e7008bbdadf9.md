# Form.ControlBox Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Specifies whether a form has a  **Control** menu in Form view and Datasheet view. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ControlBox**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks

The default value is  **True**.

Setting the  **ControlBox** property to **False** also removes the **Minimize**,  **Maximize**, and  **Close** buttons on a form.

It can only be set in form Design view.

To display a  **Control** menu on a form, the **ControlBox** property must be set to Yes and the form's **BorderStyle**property must be set to Thin, Sizable, or Dialog.

Even when a form's  **ControlBox** property is set to No, the form always has a **Control** menu when opened in Design view.

Setting the  **ControlBox** property to No suppresses the **Control** menu when you:


- Open the form in Form view from the Database window.
    
- Open the form from a macro.
    
- Open the form from Visual Basic.
    
- Open the form in Datasheet view.
    
- Switch to Form or Datasheet view from Design view.
