
# Sum Function (Microsoft Access SQL)

Returns the sum of a set of values contained in a specified field on a query.


## Syntax

 **Sum(**_expr_**)**

The  _expr_ placeholder represents a string expression identifying the field that contains the numeric data you want to add or an expression that performs a calculation using the data in that field. Operands in _expr_ can include the name of a table field, a constant, or a function (which can be either intrinsic or user-defined but not one of the other SQL aggregate functions).


## Remarks

The  **Sum** function totals the values in a field. For example, you could use the **Sum** function to determine the total cost of freight charges.

The  **Sum** function ignores records that contain **Null** fields. The following example shows how you can calculate the sum of the products of UnitPrice and Quantity fields:




```
SELECT 
Sum(UnitPrice * Quantity) 
AS [Total Revenue] FROM [Order Details];
```

You can use the  **Sum** function in a query expression. You can also use this expression in the **SQL** property of a **QueryDef** object or when creating a **Recordset** based on an SQL query.


## Example

This example uses the Orders table to calculate the total sales for orders shipped to the United Kingdom.

This example calls the EnumFields procedure, which you can find in the SELECT statement example.




```
Sub SumX() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset 
 
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    ' Calculate the total sales for orders shipped to 
    ' the United Kingdom.   
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT" _ 
        &amp; " Sum(UnitPrice*Quantity)" _ 
        &amp; " AS [Total UK Sales] FROM Orders" _ 
        &amp; " INNER JOIN [Order Details] ON" _ 
        &amp; " Orders.OrderID = [Order Details].OrderID" _ 
        &amp; " WHERE (ShipCountry = 'UK');") 
 
    ' Populate the Recordset. 
    rst.MoveLast 
 
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the  
    ' Recordset. Pass the Recordset object and desired 
    ' field width. 
    EnumFields rst, 15 
     
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
