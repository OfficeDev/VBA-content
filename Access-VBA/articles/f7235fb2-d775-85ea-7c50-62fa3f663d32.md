 [Example](#sectionSection2)


The  **Add** method adds a new ** [Page](6351b0ea-bd07-5ee6-ea20-0d410e09d939.md)**object to the  ** [Pages](e77c8d31-1cb7-d647-6faa-2eb234ce0708.md)**collection of a tab control.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Add**( **_Before_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Pages** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Before|Optional| **Variant**|An  **Integer** that specifies the index of the **Page** object before which the new **Page** object should be added. The index of the **Page** object corresponds to the value of the **PageIndex**property for that  **Page** object. If you omit this argument, the new **Page** object is added to the end of the collection.|

### Return Value

Page


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The first  **Page** object in the **Pages** collection corresponds to the leftmost page in the tab control and has an index of 0. The second **Page** object is immediately to the right of the first page and has an index of 1, and so on for all the **Page** objects in the tab control.

If you specify 0 for the Before argument, the new **Page** object is added before the first **Page** object in the **Pages** collection. The new **Page** object then becomes the first **Page** object in the collection, with an index of 0.

You can add a  **Page** object to the **Pages** collection of a tab control only when the form is in Design view.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example adds a page to a tab control on a form that's in Design view. To try this example, create a new form named Form1 with a tab control named TabCtl0. Paste the following code into a standard module and run it:


```
Function AddPage() As Boolean 
 Dim frm As Form 
 Dim tbc As TabControl, pge As Page 
 
 On Error GoTo Error_AddPage 
 Set frm = Forms!Form1 
 Set tbc = frm!TabCtl0 
 tbc.Pages.Add 
 AddPage = True 
 
Exit_AddPage: 
 Exit Function 
 
Error_AddPage: 
 MsgBox Err &amp; ": " &amp; Err.Description 
 AddPage = False 
 Resume Exit_AddPage 
End Function
```
