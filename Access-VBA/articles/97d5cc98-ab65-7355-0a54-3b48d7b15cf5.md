## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **MinNumber**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ListDataFormat** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 This property will return the **Nothing** object if no value has been specified for this field or if the setting of the **Type** property is such that a minimum value is not applicable to the column.

This property is used only for lists that are linked to a SharePoint site.

In Microsoft Excel, you cannot set any of the properties associated with the  **ListDataFormat** object. You can set these properties, however, by modifying the list on the SharePoint site.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example displays the setting of the  **MinNumber** property for the third column of a list in Sheet1 of the active workbook.


```
 
 Dim wrksht As Worksheet 
 Dim objListCol As ListColumn 
 
 Set wrksht = ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1") 
 Set objListCol = wrksht.ListObjects(1).ListColumns(3) 
 
 Debug.Print objListCol.ListDataFormat.MinNumber
```
