 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **ActiveForm** property together with the ** [Screen](00743775-071b-9ccd-7687-f3b992e9346e.md)**object to identify or refer to the form that has the focus. Read-only  **Form** object.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ActiveForm**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Screen** object.


## Remarks

This property setting contains a reference to the  ** [Form](72ef9219-142b-b690-b696-3eba9a5d4522.md)**object that has the focus at run time.

You can use the  **ActiveForm** property to refer to an active form together with one of its properties or methods. The following example displays the **Name**property setting of the active form.




```
Dim frmCurrentForm As Form 
Set frmCurrentForm = Screen.ActiveForm 
MsgBox "Current form is " &amp; frmCurrentForm.Name
```

If a subform has the focus,  **ActiveForm** refers to the main form. If no form or subform has the focus when you use the **ActiveForm** property, an error occurs.
