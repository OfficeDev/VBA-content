# Application.OnWindow Property (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets the name of the procedure that's run whenever you activate a window. Read/write  **String**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **OnWindow**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks

The procedure specified by this property isn't run when other procedures switch to the window or when a command to switch to a window is received through a DDE channel. Instead, the procedure responds to the user's actions, such as clicking a window with the mouse.

If a worksheet or macro sheet has an Auto_Activate or Auto_Deactivate macro defined for it, those macros will be run after the procedure specified by the  ** [OnWindow](73ae5d34-66e6-3c1e-07f8-08850d13a4f5.md)** property.
