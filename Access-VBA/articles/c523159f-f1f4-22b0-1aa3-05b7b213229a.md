You can use the  **ForceNewPage** property to specify whether form sections detail, footer) or report sections (header, detail, footer) print on a separate page, rather than on the current page. Read/write **Byte**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ForceNewPage**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Section** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For example, you may have designed the last page of a report as an order form. If the report footer's  **ForceNewPage** property is set to Before Section, the order form is always printed on a new page.


 **Note**  The  **ForceNewPage** property does not apply to page headers or page footers.

The  **ForceNewPage** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|None|0|(Default) The current section (the section for which you're setting the property) is printed on the current page.|
|Before Section|1|The current section is printed at the top of a new page.|
|After Section|2|The section immediately following the current section is printed at the top of a new page.|
|Before &amp; After|3|The current section is printed at the top of a new page, and the next section is printed at the top of a new page.|
Here are some examples of the  **ForceNewPage** property setting.



|**Section**|**Sample setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|A group header displaying the year|Before Section|The group header is printed at the top of the page, followed by the detail section, group footer, and page footer.|
