The returned  **Recordset** object is available for use. You can examine, navigate, or edit it as you would any other **Recordset**. What you can do with the **Recordset** depends on your environment. Visual Basic and Visual C++ have visual controls that can use a **Recordset** directly or indirectly with the aid of an enabling data control.

For example, if you are displaying a Web page in Microsoft Internet Explorer, you might want to display the  **Recordset** object data in a visual control. Visual controls on a Web page cannot access a **Recordset** object directly. However, they can access the **Recordset** object through the[RDS.DataControl](ac430669-7628-696c-c036-b5d35405d788.md). The  **RDS.DataControl** becomes usable by a visual control when its[SourceRecordset](5f4bb72d-ddfa-41c0-c353-b3a6632b4a91.md) property is set to the **Recordset** object.
The visual control object must have its  **DATASRC** parameter set to the **RDS.DataControl**, and its **DATAFLD** property set to a **Recordset** object field (column).
In this tutorial, set the  **SourceRecordset** property:



```vb
Sub RDSTutorial5() 
 Dim DS as New RDS.DataSpace 
 Dim RS as ADODB.Recordset 
 Dim DC as New RDS.DataControl 
 Dim DF as Object 
 Set DF = DS.CreateObject("RDSServer.DataFactory", "http://yourServer") 
 Set RS = DF.Query ("DSN=Pubs", "SELECT * FROM Authors") 
 DC.SourceRecordset = RS ' Visual controls can now bind to DC. 
'... 
End Sub
```
