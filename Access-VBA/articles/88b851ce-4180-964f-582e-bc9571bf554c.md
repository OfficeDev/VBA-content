# Workspaces Collection (DAO)

 **Last modified:** March 16, 2012

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **Workspaces** collection contains all active, unhidden **Workspace** objects of the **DBEngine** object. (Hidden **Workspace** objects are not appended to the collection and referenced by the variable to which they are assigned.)


## Remarks

Use the  **Workspace** object to manage the current session or to start an additional session.

When you first refer to or use a  **Workspace** object, you automatically create the default workspace, `DBEngine.Workspaces(0)`. The settings of the  **Name** and **UserName** properties of the default workspace are "#Default Workspace#" and "Admin," respectively. If security is enabled, the **UserName** property setting is the name of the user who logged on.

You can create new  **Workspace** objects with the **[CreateWorkspace](a7d73771-9420-0448-99e6-d6c4aa78683a.md)** method. After you create a new **Workspace** object, you must append it to the **Workspaces** collection if you need to refer to it from the **Workspaces** collection. You can, however, use a newly created **Workspace** object without appending it to the **Workspaces** collection.

To refer to a  **Workspace** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:

 **DBEngine**. **Workspaces** (0)

 **DBEngine**. **Workspaces** (" _name_")

 **DBEngine**. **Workspaces** ![ _name_]


 **Note**  ODBCDirect workspaces are not supported in Microsoft Access 2013. Use ADO if you want to access external data sources without using the Microsoft Access database engine.


## Example

This example creates a new Microsoft Access Workspace object and appends it to the  **Workspaces** collection. It then enumerates the **Workspaces** collections and the **Properties** collection of the **Workspace** object.


```vb
Sub WorkspaceX() 
 
 Dim wrkNewAcc As Workspace 
 Dim wrkLoop As Workspace 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 ' Create a new Microsoft Access workspace. 
 Set wrkNewAcc = CreateWorkspace("NewAccessWorkspace", _ 
 "admin", "", dbUseJet) 
 Workspaces.Append wrkNewAcc 
 
 ' Enumerate the Workspaces collection. 
 For Each wrkLoop In Workspaces 
 With wrkLoop 
 Debug.Print "Properties of " &; .Name 
 ' Enumerate the Properties collection of the new 
 ' Workspace object. 
 For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
 On Error Resume Next 
 If prpLoop <> "" Then Debug.Print " " &; _ 
 prpLoop.Name &; " = " &; prpLoop 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 Next prpLoop 
 End With 
 Next wrkLoop 
 
 wrkNewAcc.Close 
End Sub
```

This example uses the  **CreateWorkspace** method to create a Microsoft Access workspace. It then lists the properties of theworkspace.




```vb
Sub CreateWorkspaceX() 
 
 Dim wrkAcc As Workspace 
 Dim wrkLoop As Workspace 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 
 DefaultType = dbUseJet 
 ' Create an unnamed Workspace object of the type 
 ' specified by the DefaultType property of DBEngine 
 ' (dbUseJet). 
 Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("", "admin", "") 
 
 ' Enumerate Workspaces collection. 
 Debug.Print "Workspace objects in Workspaces collection:" 
 For Each wrkLoop In Workspaces 
 Debug.Print " " &; wrkLoop.Name 
 Next wrkLoop 
 
 With wrkAcc 
 ' Enumerate Properties collection of Microsoft Access 
 ' workspace. 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "Properties of unnamed Microsoft Access workspace" 
 On Error Resume Next 
 For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
 Debug.Print " " &; prpLoop.Name &; " = " &; prpLoop 
 Next prpLoop 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 End With 
 
 wrkAcc.Close 
 
End Sub
```
