 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns or sets which macro, event procedure, or user-defined function runs when the  **AfterUpdate**event occurs. Read/write  **String**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **AfterUpdate**

 _expression_An expression that returns an  **Attachment** object.


## Remarks

The  **AfterUpdate** event applies only to controls on a form, not controls on a report.

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **AfterUpdate**property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

The  **AfterUpdate** event is triggered when a control or record is updated. Within a record, changed data in each control is updated when the control loses the focus or when the user presses ENTER or TAB.

 **AfterUpdate** macros and event procedures run only if you change the data in a control. This event does not occur when a value changes in a calculated control. **AfterUpdate** macros and event procedures for a form run only if you change the data in one or more controls in the record.
