 [Example](#sectionSection2)


You can use the  **PreviousControl** property with the ** [Screen](00743775-071b-9ccd-7687-f3b992e9346e.md)**object to return a reference to the control that last received the focus. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **PreviousControl**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Screen** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **PreviousControl** property contains a reference to the control that last had the focus. Once you establish a reference to the control, you can access all the properties and methods of the control.

You can't use the  **PreviousControl** property until more than one control on any form has received the focus after a form is opened. Microsoft Access generates an error if you attempt to use this property when only one control on a form has received the focus.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example displays a message if the control that last received the focus wasn't the  `txtFinalEntry` text box.


```
Public Function ProcessData() As Integer 
 
 ' No previous control error. 
 Const conNoPreviousControl = 2483 
 Dim ctlPrevious As Control 
 
 On Error GoTo Process_Err 
 
 Set ctlPrevious = Screen.PreviousControl 
 If ctlPrevious.Name = "txtFinalEntry" Then 
 ' 
 ' Process Data Here. 
 ' 
 ProcessData = True 
 Else 
 ' Set focus to txtFinalEntry and display message. 
 Me!txtFinalEntry.SetFocus 
 MsgBox "Please enter a value here." 
 ProcessData = False 
 End If 
 
Process_Exit: 
 Set ctlPrevious = Nothing 
 Exit Function 
 
Process_Err: 
 If Err = conNoPreviousControl Then 
 Me!txtFinalEntry.SetFocus 
 MsgBox "Please enter a value to process.", vbInformation 
 ProcessData = False 
 End If 
 Resume Process_Exit 
 
End Function
```
