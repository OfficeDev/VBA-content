# Report.Timer Event (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **Timer** event occurs for a report at regular intervals as specified by the report's ** [TimerInterval](272fb1f6-2aca-60c2-1f0f-d901e0da91ac.md)** property.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Timer**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.


## Remarks

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnTimer** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

By running a macro or event procedure when a  **Timer** event occurs, you can control what Microsoft Access does at every timer interval. For example, you might want to requery underlying records or repaint the screen at specified intervals.

The  **TimerInterval** property setting of the report specifies the interval, in milliseconds, between **Timer** events. The interval can be between 0 and 2,147,483,647 milliseconds. Setting the **TimerInterval** property to 0 prevents the **Timer** event from occurring.
