# ConnectorFormat.EndDisconnect Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Detaches the end of the specified connector from the shape it's attached to. This method doesn't alter the size or position of the connector: the end of the connector remains positioned at a connection site but is no longer connected. Use the  ** [BeginDisconnect](1edd106a-9f02-3916-401c-1b026e40d75a.md)**method to detach the beginning of the connector from a shape.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **EndDisconnect**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ConnectorFormat** object.


## Example

This example adds two rectangles to  `myDocument`, attaches them with a connector, automatically reroutes the connector along the shortest path, and then detaches the connector from the rectangles.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
Set s = myDocument.Shapes 
Set firstRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 100, 50, 200, 100) 
Set secondRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 300, 300, 200, 100) 
set c = s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, 0, 0, 0, 0) 
with c.ConnectorFormat 
 .BeginConnect firstRect, 1 
 .EndConnect secondRect, 1 
 c.RerouteConnections 
 .BeginDisconnect 
 .EndDisconnect 
End With
```
