
# Compact and Repair a Database

Access database files (.accdb) can grow quickly as you use them, sometimes impeding performance. They can also occasionally become corrupted or damaged. You can use the 
**CompactRepair** method on the **Access.Application** object to prevent or fix these problems.

The **CompactRepair** method 
compacts a bloated database file,
and if the database file is corrupted, repairs the database file and creates a log file. 
This method returns a  **Boolean** value based on whether the recovery was successful (*True* for success).

## Example

The following code example demonstrates how to use the **CompactRepair** method.  

```vb
' Example driver application.
Sub Test()

Dim repaired As Boolean

' You can simply make up a name for the destination file.
repaired = RepairDatabase("C:\Users\Public\Documents\Database.accdb", _
                              "C:\Users\Public\Documents\DatabaseRepaired.accdb")

MsgBox repaired

End Sub

' Input values: The fully-qualified path names of the source and destination
' database files.
Function RepairDatabase(sourceDb As String, destDb As String) As Boolean
 
' Compact and repair the database. You can use the return value of the
' CompactRepair method to determine if the file was successfully compacted.
RepairDatabase = Access.Application.CompactRepair(sourceDb, destDb, True)

End Function
```
