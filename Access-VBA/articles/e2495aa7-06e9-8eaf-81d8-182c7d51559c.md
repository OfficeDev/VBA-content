## Syntax

 _expression_. **DateGrouping**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.

For example, using the US Defaults setting will cause the week to begin on Sunday. If you set a Date/Time field's  ** [GroupOn](7fb9551f-5742-39a2-1cf3-7b3975ae517a.md)**property to Week, the report will group dates from Sunday to Saturday.

The  **DateGrouping** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|US Defaults|0|Microsoft Access uses the U.S. settings for the first day of the week (Sunday) and the first week of the year (starts on January 1).|
|Use System Settings|1|(Default) Microsoft Access uses settings based on the locale selected in the  **Regional Options** dialog box in Windows Control Panel.|

 **Note**  The  **DateGrouping** property setting applies to the entire report, not to a particular group in the report.

You can set the  **DateGrouping** property only in report Design view or in the ** [Open](d170b67d-3123-6f51-6cf8-38433736f104.md)**event procedure of a report.

The sort order used in a report isn't affected by the  **DateGrouping** property setting.
