# Field Object (DAO)

A  **Field** object represents a column of data with a common data type and a common set of properties.


## Remarks

The  **Fields** collections of **Index**, **QueryDef**, **Relation**, and **TableDef** objects contain the specifications for the fields those objects represent. The **Fields** collection of a **Recordset** object represents the **Field** objects in a row of data, or in a record. You use the **Field** objects in a **Recordset** object to read and set values for the fields in the current record of the **Recordset** object.

In a Microsoft Access workspacee, you manipulate a field using a  **Field** object and its methods and properties. For example, you can:




- Use the  **OrdinalPosition** property to set or return the presentation order of the **Field** object in a **Fields** collection.
    
- Use the  **Value** property of a field in a **Recordset** object to set or return stored data.
    
- Use the  **AppendChunk** and **GetChunk** methods and the **FieldSize** property to get or set a value in an OLE Object or Memo field of a **Recordset** object.
    
- Use the  **Type**, **Size**, and **Attributes** properties to determine the type of data that can be stored in the field.
    
- Use the  **SourceField** and **SourceTable** properties to determine the original source of the data.
    





- Use the  **ForeignName** property to set or return information about a foreign field in a **Relation** object.
    
- Use the  **AllowZeroLength**, **DefaultValue**, **Required**, **ValidateOnSet**, **ValidationRule**, or **ValidationText** properties to set or return validation conditions.
    
- Use the  **DefaultValue** property of a field on a **TableDef** object to set the default value for this field when new records are added.
    


To create a new  **Field** object in an **Index**, **TableDef**, or **Relation** object, use the **CreateField** method.

When you access a  **Field** object as part of a **Recordset** object, data from the current record is visible in the **Field** object's **Value** property. To manipulate data in the **Recordset** object, you don't usually reference the **Fields** collection directly; instead, you indirectly reference the **Value** property of the **Field** object in the **Fields** collection of the **Recordset** object.

To refer to a  **Field** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:

 **Fields** (0)

 **Fields** (" _name_")

 **Fields** ![ _name_]

With the same syntax forms, you can also refer to the  **Value** property of a **Field** object that you create and append to a **Fields** collection. The context of the field reference will determine whether you are referring to the **Field** object or the **Value** property of the **Field** object.


## Example

This example shows what properties are valid for a  **Field** object depending on where the **Field** resides (for example, the **Fields** collection of a **TableDef**, the **Fields** collection of a **QueryDef**, and so forth). The FieldOutput procedure is required for this procedure to run.


```vb
Sub FieldX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim fldTableDef As Field 
 Dim fldQueryDef As Field 
 Dim fldRecordset As Field 
 Dim fldRelation As Field 
 Dim fldIndex As Field 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees") 
 
 ' Assign a Field object from different Fields 
 ' collections to object variables. 
 Set fldTableDef = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.TableDefs(0).Fields(0) 
 Set fldQueryDef =dbsNorthwind.QueryDefs(0).Fields(0) 
 Set fldRecordset = rstEmployees.Fields(0) 
 Set fldRelation =dbsNorthwind.Relations(0).Fields(0) 
 Set fldIndex = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.TableDefs(0).Indexes(0).Fields(0) 
 
 ' Print report. 
 FieldOutput "TableDef", fldTableDef 
 FieldOutput "QueryDef", fldQueryDef 
 FieldOutput "Recordset", fldRecordset 
 FieldOutput "Relation", fldRelation 
 FieldOutput "Index", fldIndex 
 
 rstEmployees.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Sub FieldOutput(strTemp As String, fldTemp As Field) 
 ' Report function for FieldX. 
 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 Debug.Print "Valid Field properties in " &; strTemp 
 
 ' Enumerate Properties collection of passed Field 
 ' object. 
 For Each prpLoop In fldTemp.Properties 
 ' Some properties are invalid in certain 
 ' contexts (the Value property in the Fields 
 ' collection of a TableDef for example). Any 
 ' attempt to use an invalid property will 
 ' trigger an error. 
 On Error Resume Next 
 Debug.Print " " &; prpLoop.Name &; " = " &; _ 
 prpLoop.Value 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 Next prpLoop 
 
End Sub
```

This example uses the  **CreateField** method to create three **Fields** for a new **TableDef**. It then displays the properties of those **Field** objects that are automatically set by the **CreateField** method. (Properties whose values are empty at the time of **Field** creation are not shown.)




```vb
Sub CreateFieldX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim tdfNew As TableDef 
 Dim fldLoop As Field 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 Set tdfNew = dbsNorthwind.CreateTableDef("NewTableDef") 
 
 ' Create and append new Field objects for the new 
 ' TableDef object. 
 With tdfNew 
 ' The CreateField method will set a default Size 
 ' for a new Field object if one is not specified. 
 .Fields.Append .CreateField("TextField", dbText) 
 .Fields.Append .CreateField("IntegerField", dbInteger) 
 .Fields.Append .CreateField("DateField", dbDate) 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.TableDefs.Append tdfNew 
 
 Debug.Print "Properties of new Fields in " &; tdfNew.Name 
 
 ' Enumerate Fields collection to show the properties of 
 ' the new Field objects. 
 For Each fldLoop In tdfNew.Fields 
 Debug.Print " " &; fldLoop.Name 
 
 For Each prpLoop In fldLoop.Properties 
 ' Properties that are invalid in the context of 
 ' TableDefs will trigger an error if an attempt 
 ' is made to read their values. 
 On Error Resume Next 
 Debug.Print " " &; prpLoop.Name &; " - " &; _ 
 IIf(prpLoop = "", "[empty]", prpLoop) 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 Next prpLoop 
 
 Next fldLoop 
 
 ' Delete new TableDef because this is a demonstration. 
 dbsNorthwind.TableDefs.Delete tdfNew.Name 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub
```
