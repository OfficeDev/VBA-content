Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
Set s = myDocument.Shapes 
Set firstRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, _ 
 100, 50, 200, 100) 
Set secondRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, _ 
 300, 300, 200, 100) 
lastsite = secondRect.ConnectionSiteCount 
With s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, _ 
 0, 0, 100, 100).ConnectorFormat 
 .BeginConnect ConnectedShape:=firstRect, _ 
 ConnectionSite:=1 
 .EndConnect ConnectedShape:=secondRect, _ 
 ConnectionSite:=1 
End With 
With s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, _ 
 0, 0, 100, 100).ConnectorFormat 
 .BeginConnect ConnectedShape:=firstRect, _ 
 ConnectionSite:=1 
 .EndConnect ConnectedShape:=secondRect, _ 
 ConnectionSite:=lastsite
