# Prevent the Accidental Erasure of Data When Moving Between Controls on a Form

When you tab from one text box or memo field to another in a form, the text in the control is highlighted. This makes it easy for users to accidentally delete the text by pressing a key. By using a few lines of code, you can move the insertion point to the first position in the text box, minimizing the risk of accidentally deleting the text. 

To do this, create a procedure for the text box's  ** [GotFocus](BC5D12A2-476B-A91D-2AD4-CDD6F46DD44C.md)** event. In the **GotFocus** event procedure, set the ** [SelLength](0FB2371D-0F60-B0C7-5C4B-7A0689867B21.md)** property of the text box to its ** [SelStart](056196B5-828A-F276-DA26-983C8B47CD05.md)** property. The following example illustrates how to do this for a text box named **txtFirstName**.



```
Private Sub txtFirstName_GotFocus() 
 
    Me.txtFirstName.SelLength = Me.txtFirstName.SelStart 
 
End Sub
```
