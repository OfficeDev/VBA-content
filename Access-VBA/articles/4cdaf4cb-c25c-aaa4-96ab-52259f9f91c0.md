You can use the  **Run** method to carry out a specified Microsoft Access or user-defined **Function** or **Sub** procedure. **Variant**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Run**( **_Procedure_**,  **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**,  **_Arg3_**,  **_Arg4_**,  **_Arg5_**,  **_Arg6_**,  **_Arg7_**,  **_Arg8_**,  **_Arg9_**,  **_Arg10_**,  **_Arg11_**,  **_Arg12_**,  **_Arg13_**,  **_Arg14_**,  **_Arg15_**,  **_Arg16_**,  **_Arg17_**,  **_Arg18_**,  **_Arg19_**,  **_Arg20_**,  **_Arg21_**,  **_Arg22_**,  **_Arg23_**,  **_Arg24_**,  **_Arg25_**,  **_Arg26_**,  **_Arg27_**,  **_Arg28_**,  **_Arg29_**,  **_Arg30_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Procedure|Required| **String**|The name of the  **Function** or **Sub** procedure to be run. If you are calling a procedure in another database use the project name and the procedure name separated by a dot in the form: "projectname.procedurename". If you execute Visual Basic code containing the  **Run** method in a library database, Microsoft Access looks for the procedure first in the library database, then in the current database.|
|Arg1, Arg2, ...Arg30|Optional| **Variant**|The arguments that should be passed to the  **Function** or **Sub** specified in theProcedure argument.|

### Return Value

Variant


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

This method is useful when you are controlling Microsoft Access from another application through Automation, formerly called OLE Automation. For example, you can use the  **Run** method from an ActiveX component to carry out a **Sub** procedure that is defined within a Microsoft Access database.

You can set a reference to the Microsoft Access type library from any other ActiveX component and use the objects, methods, and properties defined in that library in your code. However, you can't set a reference to an individual Microsoft Access database from any application other than Microsoft Access.

For example, suppose you have defined a procedure named NewForm in a database with its  **ProjectName** property set to "WizCode." The NewForm procedure takes a string argument. You can call NewForm in the following manner from Visual Basic:




```
Dim appAccess As New Access.Application 
appAccess.OpenCurrentDatabase ("C:\My Documents\WizCode.mdb") 
appAccess.Run "WizCode.NewForm", "Some String"
```

If another procedure with the same name may reside in a different database, qualify the procedure argument, as shown in the preceding example, with the name of the database in which the desired procedure resides.

You can also use the  **Run** method to call a procedure in a referenced Microsoft Access database from another database.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example runs a user-defined  **Sub** procedure in a module in a Microsoft Access database from another application that acts as an Active X component.

To try this example, create a new database called WizCode.mdb and set its  **ProjectName** property to WizCode. Open a new module in that database and enter the following code. Save the module, and close the database.


 **Note**  You set the  **ProjectName** by selecting Tools, WizCode Properties... from the VBE main menu.




```
Public Sub Greeting(ByVal strName As String) 
 MsgBox ("Hello, " &amp; strName &amp; "!"), vbInformation, "Greetings" 
End Sub
```

Once you have completed this step, run the following code from Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Visual Basic. Make sure that you have added a reference to the Microsoft Access type library by clicking  **References** on the **Tools** menu and selecting **Microsoft Access 12.0 Object Library** in the **References** dialog box.




```
Private Sub RunAccessSub() 
 
 Dim appAccess As Access.Application 
 
 ' Create instance of Access Application object. 
 Set appAccess = CreateObject("Access.Application") 
 
 ' Open WizCode database in Microsoft Access window. 
 appAccess.OpenCurrentDatabase "C:\My Documents\WizCode.mdb", False 
 
 ' Run Sub procedure. 
 appAccess.Run "Greeting", "Joe" 
 Set appAccess = Nothing 
 
End Sub
```
