# OLEDBErrors Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of  ** [OLEDBError](6bcbf721-f2c8-f784-361b-e1a298bb2ecb.md)** objects.

## Remarks

 Each **OLEDBError** object represents an error returned by the most recent OLE DB query. If the specified OLE DB query runs without error, the **OLEDBErrors** collection is empty. The errors in the collection are indexed in the order in which they're generated by the OLE DB provider. You cannot add members to the collection.


## Example

Use the  ** [OLEDBErrors](0a42417f-f8b6-10bf-712a-44c1107f0f3e.md)** property to return the **OLEDBErrors** collection. The following example displays the error description and the ** [SqlState](cd05c61a-da9f-5022-c359-b90351e6489d.md)** property's value for each OLE DB error in the collection.


```
For Each objEr in Application.OLEDBErrors 
 MsgBox "The following error occurred:" &amp; _ 
 objEr.ErrorString &amp; " : " &amp; objEr.SqlState 
Next objEr
```

Use  **OLEDBErrors**( _index_), where  _index_ is the index number of the OLE DB error, to return a single **OLEDBError** object. The following example displays the error description and the **SqlState** property's value for the first error returned by the most recent OLE DB query.




```
Set objEr = Application.OLEDBErrors(1) 
MsgBox "The following error occurred:" &amp; _ 
 objEr.ErrorString &amp; " : " &amp; objEr.SqlState
```
