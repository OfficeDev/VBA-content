You can use the  **RecordsetClone** property to refer to a form's **Recordset** object specified by the form's ** [RecordSource](a473695a-7645-744d-bf69-760e1f2b9fb1.md)** property. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RecordsetClone**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **RecordsetClone** property setting is a copy of the underlying query or table specified by the form's **RecordSource** property. If a form is based on a query, for example, referring to the **RecordsetClone** property is the equivalent of cloning a **Recordset** object by using the same query. If you then apply a filter to the form, the **Recordset** object reflects the filtering.

This property is available only by using  [Visual Basic](3fa3677b-a779-3bc7-0f0f-827c252b3292.md) and is read-only in all views.

You use the  **RecordsetClone** property to navigate or operate on a form's records independent of the form itself. For example, you can use the **RecordsetClone** property when you want to use a method, such as the DAO **Find** methods, that can't be used with forms.

When a new  **Recordset** object is opened, its first record is the current record. If you one of the **Find** method or one of the **Move** methods to make any other record in the **Recordset** object current, you must synchronize the current record in the **Recordset** object with the form's current record by assigning the value of the DAO **Bookmark** property to the form's ** [Bookmark](e214a924-9110-a3de-9812-b9ec5cbad8ed.md)** property.

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example uses the  **RecordsetClone** property to create a new clone of the **Recordset** object from the Orders form and then prints the names of the fields in the Immediate window.


```
Sub Print_Field_Names() 
    Dim rst As Recordset, intI As Integer 
    Dim fld As Field 
 
    Set rst = Me.RecordsetClone 
    For Each fld in rst.Fields 
        ' Print field names. 
        Debug.Print fld.Name 
    Next 
End Sub
```

The next example uses the  **RecordsetClone** property and the **Recordset** object to synchronize a recordset's record with the form's current record. When a company name is selected from a combo box, the **FindFirst** method is used to locate the record for that company and the **Recordset** object's DAO **Bookmark** property is assigned to the form's **Bookmark** property, causing the form to display the found record.




```
Sub SupplierID_AfterUpdate() 
    Dim rst As Recordset 
    Dim strSearchName As String 
 
    Set rst = Me.RecordsetClone 
    strSearchName = Str(Me!SupplierID) 
    rst.FindFirst "SupplierID = " &amp; strSearchName 
        If rst.NoMatch Then 
            MsgBox "Record not found" 
        Else 
            Me.Bookmark = rst.Bookmark 
        End If 
    rst.Close 
End Sub
```

You can use the  **RecordCount** property to count the number of records in a **Recordset** object. The following example shows how you can combine the **RecordCount** property and the **RecordsetClone** property to count the records in a form:




```
Forms!Orders.RecordsetClone.MoveLast 
MsgBox "My form contains " _ 
    &amp; Forms!Orders.RecordsetClone.RecordCount _ 
    &amp; " records.", vbInformation, "Record Count"
```
