# Series Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a series in a chart.

## Remarks

 The **Series** object is a member of the ** [SeriesCollection](93aa1f0b-4939-8c60-a444-2f791e8ce144.md)** collection.


## Example

Use  **SeriesCollection**( _index_), where  _index_ is the series index number or name, to return a single **Series** object. The following example sets the color of the interior for the first series in embedded chart one on Sheet1.

The series index number indicates the order in which the series were added to the chart.  `SeriesCollection(1)` is the first series added to the chart, and `SeriesCollection(SeriesCollection.Count)` is the last one added.




```
Worksheets("sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Chart. _ 
 SeriesCollection(1).Interior.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
```
