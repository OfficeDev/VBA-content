To run the Address Book application, follow this procedure.

 **To run this application**

1. Make sure that Microsoft SQL Server is running. Click  **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 7.0**, and then click **Service Manager**. If there is a green arrow in the white circle, then SQL Server is running. If it is not (there will be a red square in the white circle), click **Start/Continue**.
    
2. In Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later, type the following address: **http://** _webserver_ **/RDS/AddressBook/AddrBook.asp** where _webserver_ is the name of the Web server where the RDS server components are installed.
    
3. You can then try various scenarios in the Address Book sample application, such as searching for a person based on his or her e-mail name, listing all people with the title "Program Manager," or editing existing records. Click  **Find** to fill the data grid with all the available names.
