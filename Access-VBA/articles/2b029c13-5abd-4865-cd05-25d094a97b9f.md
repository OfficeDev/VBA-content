The following example illustrates how to open a report based on the filtered contents of a form. To do this, specify the form's  ** [Filter](5EB49F82-8519-981C-A663-9862736AC95F.md)** property as the value of the ** [OpenReport](3C08755A-5116-F085-D498-725DC12E62F1.md)** method's _WhereCondition_ argument.




```
Private Sub cmdOpenReport_Click() 
    If Me.Filter = "" Then 
        MsgBox "Apply a filter to the form first." 
    Else 
        DoCmd.OpenReport "rptCustomers", acViewReport, , Me.Filter 
    End If 
End Sub
```
