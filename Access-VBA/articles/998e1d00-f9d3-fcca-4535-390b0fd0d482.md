By default, the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys can be used to navigate between records in a form. The followng example illustrates how to use a form's  ** [KeyDown](CEB66DB0-695A-E3B1-F0F7-6C9BD9191B2B.md)** event to disable the use of the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys in the form.




```
Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer) 
 
    ' The Keycode value represents the key that 
    ' triggered the event. 
    Select Case KeyCode 
    
        ' Check for the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys. 
        Case 33, 34 
 
        ' Cancel the keystroke. 
        KeyCode = 0 
    End Select 
End Sub
```


 **Note**  You must set the form's  ** [KeyPreview](F9153EC0-8B6E-60D5-8541-100E2AD1705E.md)** property to **True** in order for this procedure to work.
