# SeriesLines Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents series lines in a chart group.

## Remarks

 Series lines connect the data values from each series. Only 2-D stacked bar, 2-D stacked column, pie of pie, or bar of pie charts can have series lines. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single series line; you either have series lines turned on for all points in a chart group or you have them turned off.

If the  ** [HasSeriesLines](4285cf5b-ebb0-a6fd-49c1-d36c341bd016.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the  **SeriesLines** object are disabled.


## Example

Use the  **SeriesLines** property to return a **SeriesLines** object. The following example adds series lines to chart group one in embedded chart one on worksheet one (the chart must be a 2-D stacked bar or column chart).


```
With Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Chart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasSeriesLines = True 
 .SeriesLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
End With
```
