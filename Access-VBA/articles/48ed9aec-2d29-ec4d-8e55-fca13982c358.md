# Point Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a single point in a series in a chart.

## Remarks

 The **Point** object is a member of the ** [Points](918dc385-ed61-262e-033f-ba829f5ee8b2.md)** collection. The **Points** collection contains all the points in one series.


## Example

Use  ** [Points](9b6f08a1-3fbe-e9bc-a509-345a3d2d78b3.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the point index number, to return a single **Point** object. Points are numbered from left to right on the series. `Points(1)` is the leftmost point, and `Points(Points.Count)` is the rightmost point. The following example sets the marker style for the third point in series one in embedded chart one on worksheet one. The specified series must be a 2-D line, scatter, or radar series.


```
Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Chart. _ 
 SeriesCollection(1).Points(3).MarkerStyle = xlDiamond
```
