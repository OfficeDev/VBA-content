Valid values for this property are 0 (zero), which corresponds to the default system language, or plid + 2 whereplid is the primary language ID of a language installed on the current system. For example, the primary language ID of English is 9, so the corresponding **KeyboardLanguage** setting is 11.

Setting this property to a language that is not installed may either have no effect or cause an error.
