# Form.Cycle Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **Cycle** property to specify what happens when you press the TAB key and the focus is in the last control on a bound form. Read/write **Byte**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Cycle**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks

The  **Cycle** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|All Records|0|(Default) Pressing the TAB key from the last control on a form moves the focus to the first control in the tab order in the next record.|
|Current Record|1|Pressing the TAB key from the last control on a record moves the focus to the first control in the tab order in the same record.|
|Current Page|2|Pressing the TAB key from the last control on a page moves the focus back to the first control in the tab order on the page.|

 **Note**  You can set the  **Cycle** property by using the form's property sheet, a macro, or Visual Basic .

You can set the  **Cycle** property in any view.

When you press the TAB key on a form, the focus moves through the controls on the form according to each control's place in the tab order.

You can set the  **Cycle** property to All Records for forms designed for data entry. This allows the user to move to a new record by pressing the TAB key.


 **Note**  The  **Cycle** property only controls the TAB key behavior on the form where the property is set. If a subform control is in the tab order, once the subform control receives the focus, the **Cycle** property setting for the subform determines what happens when you press the TAB key.

To move the focus outside a subform control, press CTRL+TAB.
