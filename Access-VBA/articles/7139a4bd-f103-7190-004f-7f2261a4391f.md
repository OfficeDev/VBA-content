# PivotFormulas Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the collection of formulas for a PivotTable report. Each formula is represented by a  ** [PivotFormula](2955dad6-d686-1a83-ab56-76a00272c7e2.md)** object.

## Remarks

This object and its associated properties and methods aren't available for OLAP data sources because calculated fields and items aren't supported.


## Example

Use the  ** [PivotFormulas](fceade1d-7aa1-85c1-ca74-89460ffa6dff.md)** property to return the **PivotFormulas** collection. The following example creates a list of PivotTable formulas for the first PivotTable report on the active worksheet.


```
For Each pf in ActiveSheet.PivotTables(1).PivotFormulas 
 Cells(r, 1).Value = pf.Formula 
 r = r + 1 
Next
```
