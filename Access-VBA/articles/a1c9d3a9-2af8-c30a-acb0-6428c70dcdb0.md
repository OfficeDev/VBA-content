The  **OpenForm** method carries out the **OpenForm** action in Visual Basic.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **OpenForm**( **_FormName_**,  **_View_**,  **_FilterName_**,  **_WhereCondition_**,  **_DataMode_**,  **_WindowMode_**,  **_OpenArgs_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DoCmd** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|FormName|Required| **Variant**|A string expression that's the valid name of a form in the current database. If you execute Visual Basic code containing the  **OpenForm** method in a library database, Microsoft Access looks for the form with this name first in the library database, then in the current database.|
|View|Optional| **AcFormView**|A  ** [AcFormView](e8abcb80-a68b-5328-80d0-ce18e2cabe42.md)** constant that specifies the view in which the form will open. The default value is **acNormal**.|
|FilterName|Optional| **Variant**|A string expression that's the valid name of a query in the current database.|
|WhereCondition|Optional| **Variant**|A string expression that's a valid SQL WHERE clause without the word WHERE.|
|DataMode|Optional| **AcFormOpenDataMode**|A  ** [AcFormOpenDataMode](24c39abb-154c-39cd-3097-77be75fe917c.md)** constant that specifies the data entry mode for the form. This applies only to forms opened in Form view or Datasheet view. The default value is **acFormPropertySettings**.|
|WindowMode|Optional| **AcWindowMode**|A  ** [AcWindowMode](70335c3c-78a1-b3e3-cbda-bd7f7a99abd4.md)** constant that specifies the window mode in which the form opens. The default value is **acWindowNormal**.|
|OpenArgs|Optional| **Variant**|A string expression. This expression is used to set the form's  **OpenArgs** property. This setting can then be used by code in a form module, such as the **Open** event procedure. The **OpenArgs** property can also be referred to in macros and expressions. For example, suppose that the form you open is a continuous-form list of clients. If you want the focus to move to a specific client record when the form opens, you can specify the client name with theOpenArgs argument, and then use the **FindRecord** method to move the focus to the record for the client with the specified name.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use the  **OpenForm** method to open a form in Form view, form Design view, Print Preview, or Datasheet view. You can select data entry and window modes for the form and restrict the records that the form displays.

The maximum length of the WhereCondition argument is 32,768 characters (unlike theWhere Condition action argument in the Macro window, whose maximum length is 256 characters).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example opens the Employees form in Form view and displays only records with King in the  **LastName** field. The displayed records can be edited, and new records can be added.


```
DoCmd.OpenForm "Employees", , ,"LastName = 'King'"
```



The following example opens the  **frmMainEmployees** form in Form view and displays only records that apply to the department chosen the **cboDept** combo box. The displayed records can be edited, and new records can be added.

```

    DoCmd.OpenForm "frmMainEmployees", , , "DepartmentID=" &amp; cboDept.Value
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to use the WhereCondition argument of the **OpenForm** method to filter the records displayed on a form as it is opened.
