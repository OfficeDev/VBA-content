## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **UpdateOptions**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When a batch-mode  **[Update](aad4171a-da95-ed72-86b3-714615ea0ac8.md)** is executed, DAO and the client batch cursor library create a series of SQL UPDATE statements to make the needed changes. An SQL WHERE clause is created for each update to isolate the records that are marked as changed by the **[RecordStatus](6fbd6909-6191-d7be-9a3a-1e9908dacc2b.md)** property. Because some remote servers use triggers or other ways to enforce referential integrity, is it often important to limit the fields being updated to just those affected by the change. To do this, set the **UpdateOptions** property to one of the constants **dbCriteriaKey**, **dbCriteriaModValues**, **dbCriteriaAllCols**, or **dbCriteriaTimeStamp**. This way, only the absolute minimum amount of trigger code is executed. As a result, the update operation is executed more quickly, and with fewer potential errors.

You can also concatenate either of the constants  **dbCriteriaDeleteInsert** or **dbCriteriaUpdate** to determine whether to use a set of SQL DELETE and INSERT statements or an SQL UPDATE statement for each update when sending batched modifications back to the server. In the former case, two separate operations are required to update the record. In some cases, especially where the remote system implements DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE triggers, choosing the correct **UpdateOptions** property setting can significantly impact performance.

If you don't specify any constants,  **dbCriteriaUpdate** and **dbCriteriaKey** will be used.

Newly added records will always generate INSERT statements and deleted records will always generate DELETE statements, so this property only applies to how the cursor library updates modified records.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **BatchSize** and **UpdateOptions** properties to control aspects of any batch updating for the specified **Recordset** object.


```vb
Sub BatchSizeX() 
 
 Dim wrkMain As Workspace 
 Dim conMain As Connection 
 Dim rstTemp As Recordset 
 
 Set wrkMain = CreateWorkspace("ODBCWorkspace", _ 
 "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
 ' This DefaultCursorDriver setting is required for 
 ' batch updating. 
 wrkMain.DefaultCursorDriver = dbUseClientBatchCursor 
 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 Set conMain = wrkMain.OpenConnection("Publishers", _ 
 dbDriverNoPrompt, False, _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
 
 ' The following locking argument is required for 
 ' batch updating. 
 Set rstTemp = conMain.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "SELECT * FROM roysched", dbOpenDynaset, 0, _ 
 dbOptimisticBatch) 
 
 With rstTemp 
 ' Increase the number of statements sent to the server 
 ' during a single batch update, thereby reducing the 
 ' number of times an update would have to access the 
 ' server. 
 .BatchSize = 25 
 
 ' Change the UpdateOptions property so that the WHERE 
 ' clause of any batched statements going to the server 
 ' will include any updated columns in addition to the 
 ' key column(s). Also, any modifications to records 
 ' will be made by deleting the original record 
 ' and adding a modified version rather than just 
 ' modifying the original record. 
 .UpdateOptions = dbCriteriaModValues + _ 
 dbCriteriaDeleteInsert 
 
 ' Engage in batch updating using the new settings 
 ' above. 
 ' ... 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 conMain.Close 
 wrkMain.Close 
 
End Sub
```
