# UsedObjects Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents objects that have been allocated in a workbook.

## Example

Use the  ** [UsedObjects](bf214478-990b-35c8-1e23-a9d1732e7ef3.md)** property of the ** [Application](19b73597-5cf9-4f56-8227-b5211f657f6f.md)** object to return a **UsedObjects** collection.

Once a  **UsedObjects** collection is returned, you can determine the quantity of used objects in a Microsoft Excel application using the ** [Count](f40380a8-602c-3d4b-b288-c791a4b9c35b.md)** property.



In this example, Microsoft Excel determines the quantity of objects that have been allocated and notifies the user. This example assumes a recalculation was performed in the application and was interrupted before finishing.






```
Sub CountUsedObjects() 
 
 MsgBox "The number of used objects in this application is: " &amp; _ 
 Application.UsedObjects.Count 
 
End Sub
```
