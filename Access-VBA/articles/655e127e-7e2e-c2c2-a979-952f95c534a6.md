You can use the  **Transparent** property to specify whether a command button is solid or transparent. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Transparent**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandButton** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use the  **BackStyle**property to make other controls solid or transparent.

You can use this property to place a transparent command button over another control. For example, you could place several transparent buttons over a picture displayed in an image control and run various macros or Visual Basic event procedures depending on which part of the picture the user clicks.


 **Note**  To hide and disable a button, use the  **Visible**property. To disable a button without hiding it, use the  **Enabled**property. To hide a button only when a form or report is printed, use the  **DisplayWhen**property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example makes the command button "Preview" on the "Purchase Orders" form transparent.


```
Forms.Item("Purchase Orders").Controls.Item("Preview"). _ 
 Transparent = True
```
