# Specify Date and Time in Criteria Expressions

 **Last modified:** July 30, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Access 2013_

To specify date or time criteria for an operation, you supply a date or time value as part of the string expression that forms the  _criteria_ argument. This value must be enclosed in number signs (#).


 **Note**  The number signs indicate to Access that the  _criteria_ argument contains a date or time within a string.

Suppose that you are creating a filter for an Employees form to display records for all employees born on or after January 1, 1960. You could construct the  _criteria_ argument for the form's ** [Filter](5EB49F82-8519-981C-A663-9862736AC95F.md)** or ** [ServerFilter](18385DE5-BC0D-9D2C-F97C-5B42E3689B45.md)** property, as shown in the following example. Note the placement of the number signs.



```
Forms!Employees.Filter = "[BirthDate] >= #1-1-1960#"
```
