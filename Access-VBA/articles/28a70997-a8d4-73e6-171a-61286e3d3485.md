[Syntax](#sectionSection0)

Fills all or a part of a local cache for a  **Recordset** object that contains data from a Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC data source (Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC databases only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **FillCache**( ** _Rows_**, ** _StartBookmark_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Rows_|Optional|**Variant**|A  **Variant** ( **Integer** subtype) that specifies the number of rows to store in the cache. If you omit this argument, the value is determined by the **[CacheSize](d8d195cc-6696-0583-31eb-b9988f8b7c6f.md)** property setting.|
| _StartBookmark_|Optional|**Variant**|A  **Variant** ( **String** subtype) that specifies a bookmark. The cache is filled starting from the record indicated by this bookmark. If you omit this argument, the cache is filled starting from the record indicated by the **[CacheStart](2e9c2b0d-b382-e4d6-9406-ace0e538a7b7.md)** property.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Caching improves the performance of an application that retrieves data from a remote server. A cache is space in local memory that holds the data most recently retrieved from the server; this assumes that the data will probably be requested again while the application is running. When a user requests data, the Microsoft Access database engine checks the cache for the data first rather than retrieving it from the server, which takes more time. The cache doesn't save data that doesn't come from an ODBC data source.

Rather than waiting for the cache to be filled with records as they are retrieved, you can use the  **FillCache** method to explicitly fill the cache at any time. This is a faster way to fill the cache because **FillCache** retrieves several records at once instead of one at a time. For example, while you view each screenful of records, your application uses **FillCache** to retrieve the next screenful of records for viewing.

Any Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC data source that you access with  **Recordset** objects can have a local cache. To create the cache, open a **Recordset** object from the remote data source, and then set the **CacheSize** and **CacheStart** properties of the **Recordset**.

If rows and startbookmark create a range of records that is partially or entirely outside the range of records specified by the  **CacheSize** and **CacheStart** properties, the portion of the recordset outside this range is ignored and will not be loaded into the cache.

If  **FillCache** requests more records than the number remaining in the remote data source, the Microsoft Access database engine retrieves only the remaining records, and no error occurs.


 **Note**  


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **CreateTableDef** and **FillCache** methods and the **CacheSize**, **CacheStart** and **SourceTableName** properties to enumerate the records in a linked table twice. Then it enumerates the records twice with a 50-record cache. The example then displays the performance statistics for the uncached and cached runs through the linked table.
