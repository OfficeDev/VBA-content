 [Example](#sectionSection2)


The  **GUID** property of a ** [Reference](87853230-294e-7ab8-4aae-78b094b5e584.md)**object returns a GUID that identifies a type library in the Windows Registry. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Guid**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Reference** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Every type library has an associated GUID which is stored in the Registry. When you set a reference to a type library, Microsoft Access uses the type library's GUID to identify the type library.

You can use the  ** [AddFromGUID](df383ef3-e27c-9590-2ee7-d078060c9313.md)**method to create a  **Reference** object from a type library's GUID.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example prints the value of the  **FullPath**,  **GUID**,  **IsBroken**,  **Major**, and  **Minor** properties for each **Reference** object in the **References** collection:


```
Sub ReferenceProperties() 
 Dim ref As Reference 
 
 ' Enumerate through References collection. 
 For Each ref In References 
 ' Check IsBroken property. 
 If ref.IsBroken = False Then 
 Debug.Print "Name: ", ref.Name 
 Debug.Print "FullPath: ", ref.FullPath 
 Debug.Print "Version: ", ref.Major &amp; "." &amp; ref.Minor 
 Else 
 Debug.Print "GUIDs of broken references:" 
 Debug.Print ref.GUID 
 EndIf 
 Next ref 
End Sub
```
