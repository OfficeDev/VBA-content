# PivotFilter.Order Property (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Specifies the evaluation order of the filter among all Value filters applied to the entire PivotTable. Read/write  **Integer**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Order**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotFilter** object.


## Remarks

This property is valid only for Value and Top n type PivotFilters. A run-time error is returned if an attempt is made to set or get this property for Label and Date filters. 1 represents the first filter evaluated, 2 represents the next filter evaluated, and so on, until thenth value is reached. -1 represents an inactive filter.

If the  **EvaluationOrder** property is not specified when a new filter is added, it will be set toN+1 (whereN is the current highest **EvaluationOrder** number in the filter collection).

The property can be specified in the  **Add** method or it can be set later for a field by changing the property.

Increasing the evaluation order for a field will decrease the evaluation order of the field previously holding that evaluation order valueâ€”and all fields in between the two fieldsâ€”by one. Setting the evaluation order to the same as before will have no effect. Decreasing the evaluation order for a field will increase the evaluation order of the field previously holding that evaluation order valueâ€”and all fields in between the two fieldsâ€”by one.

 The order of PivotFilters in the collection is the same as the order in which they are evaluated. So developers can change the order in which a PivotField is evaluated. When a PivotField (non-OLAP PivotTables) or a CubeField (OLAP PivotTables) is removed from the **PivotTables** collection, this property is set to -1 for a Value or a Topn filter applied to the field. Adding the field back again will set the **EvaluationOrder** property toN+1 for a Value or Topn filter applied if a value is not explicitly specified.
