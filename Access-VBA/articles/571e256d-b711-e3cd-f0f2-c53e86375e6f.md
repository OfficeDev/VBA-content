This property isn't available for radar charts. For 3-D charts, this property can only be applied to the value axis and indicates where the plane defined by the category axes crosses the value axis.

This property can be used for both category and value axes. On the category axis,  **xlMinimum** sets the value axis to cross at the first category, and **xlMaximum** sets the value axis to cross at the last category.

Note that  **xlMinimum** and **xlMaximum** can have different meanings, depending on the axis.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example sets the value axis in Chart1 to cross the category axis at the maximum x value.


```
Charts("Chart1").Axes(xlCategory).Crosses = xlMaximum
```
