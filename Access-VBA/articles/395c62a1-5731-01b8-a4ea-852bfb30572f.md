The  **Timer** event occurs for a form at regular intervals as specified by the form's ** [TimerInterval](ee56bcf8-20cb-9d86-ed17-3b85ac88f6f1.md)** property.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Timer**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnTimer** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

By running a macro or event procedure when a  **Timer** event occurs, you can control what Microsoft Access does at every timer interval. For example, you might want to requery underlying records or repaint the screen at specified intervals.

The  **TimerInterval** property setting of the form specifies the interval, in milliseconds, between **Timer** events. The interval can be between 0 and 2,147,483,647 milliseconds. Setting the **TimerInterval** property to 0 prevents the **Timer** event from occurring.

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example demonstrates a digital clock you can display on a form. A label control displays the current time according to your computer's system clock. 

To try the example, add the following event procedure to a form that contains a label named Clock. Set the form's  **TimerInterval** property to 1000 milliseconds to update the clock every second.




```
Private Sub Form_Timer() 
    Clock.Caption = Time        ' Update time display. 
End Sub 

```
