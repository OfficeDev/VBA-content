 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


You can use the  **Column** property to refer to a specific column, or column and row combination, in a multiple-column combo box or list box. Read-only **Variant**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Column**( **_Index_**,  **_Row_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ListBox** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Index|Required| **Long**|A long integer that can range from 0 to the setting of the  **ColumnCount**property minus one.|
|Row|Optional| **Variant**|An integer that can range from 0 to the setting of the  **ListCount**property minus 1.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use 0 to refer to the first column, 1 to refer to the second column, and so on. Use 0 to refer to the first row, 1 to refer to the second row, and so on. For example, in a list box containing a column of customer IDs and a column of customer names, you could refer to the customer name in the second column and fifth row as:


```
Forms!Contacts!Customers.Column(1, 4)
```

You can use the  **Column** property to assign the contents of a combo box or list box to another control, such as a text box. For example, to set the **ControlSource**property of a text box to the value in the second column of a list box, you could use the following expression:




```
=Forms!Customers!CompanyName.Column(1)
```

If the user has made no selection when you refer to a column in a combo box or list box, the  **Column** property setting will be **Null**. You can use the  **IsNull** function to determine if a selection has been made, as in the following example:




```
If IsNull(Forms!Customers!Country) 
 Then MsgBox "No selection." 
End If
```


 **Note**  To determine how many columns a combo box or list box has, you can inspect the  **ColumnCount** property setting.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example uses the  **Column** property and the **ColumnCount** property to print the values of a list box selection.


```
Public Sub Read_ListBox() 
 
 Dim intNumColumns As Integer 
 Dim intI As Integer 
 Dim frmCust As Form 
 
 Set frmCust = Forms!frmCustomers 
 If frmCust!lstCustomerNames.ItemsSelected.Count > 0 Then 
 
 ' Any selection? 
 intNumColumns = frmCust!lstCustomerNames.ColumnCount 
 Debug.Print "The list box contains "; intNumColumns; _ 
 IIf(intNumColumns = 1, " column", " columns"); _ 
 " of data." 
 
 Debug.Print "The current selection contains:" 
 For intI = 0 To intNumColumns - 1 
 ' Print column data. 
 Debug.Print frmCust!lstCustomerNames.Column(intI) 
 Next intI 
 Else 
 Debug.Print "You haven't selected an entry in the " _ 
 &amp; "list box." 
 End If 
 
 Set frmCust = Nothing 
 
End Sub
```
