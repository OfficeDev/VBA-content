 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Occurs when an error occurs during navigation.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **NavigateError**( **_pDisp_**,  **_URL_**,  **_TargetFrameName_**,  **_StatusCode_**,  **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WebBrowserControl** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|pDisp|Required| **Object**|A pointer to an  **IDispatch** interface for the WebBrowser object that represents the window or frame in which the navigation error occurred.|
|URL|Required| **Variant**|Contains the URL for which navigation failed.|
|TargetFrameName|Required| **Variant**|Contains the name of the frame in which to display the resource, or  **NULL** if no named frame was targeted for the resource.|
|StatusCode|Required| **Variant**|Contains an error status code, if available.|
|Cancel|Required| **Boolean**|Specifies whether to cancel the navigation to an error page or to any further autosearch.|

### Return Value

nothing


## Remarks

This event fires before the  **WebBrowser** control displays an error page due to an error in navigation. You can stop the display of the error page by setting the _Cancel_ parameter to **True**. However, if the server contacted in the original navigation supplies its own substitute page navigation, when you set  _Cancel_ to **True**, it has no effect, and the navigation to the server's alternate page proceeds. For example, assume that a navigation to http://www.www.wingtiptoys.com/BigSale.htm causes this event to fire because the page does not exist. However, the server is set to redirect the navigation to http://www.www.wingtiptoys.com/home.htm. In this case, when you set  _Cancel_ to **True**, it has no effect, and navigation proceeds to http://www.www.wingtiptoys.com/home.htm.
