# GroupLevel.GroupHeader Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **GroupHeader** property to create a group header for a selected field or expression in a report. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **GroupHeader**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **GroupLevel** object.


## Remarks

You can use group headers and footers to label or summarize data in a group of records. For example, if you set the  **GroupHeader** property to Yes for the Categories field, each group of products will begin with its category name.


 **Note**  You can't set or refer to these properties directly in Visual Basic. To create a group header or footer for a field or expression in Visual Basic, use the  ** [CreateGroupLevel](880c1e36-b7b5-7ea4-a2ca-d7c3f0a5a7be.md)**method.

To set the grouping properties â€”  ** [GroupOn](7fb9551f-5742-39a2-1cf3-7b3975ae517a.md)**,  ** [GroupInterval](98ba66b9-658e-9fa6-155b-3b4f1a7c3f01.md)**, and  ** [KeepTogether](65bc99df-7b0f-ec66-5add-0943ef0cd1f3.md)**â€” to other than their default values, you must first set the  **GroupHeader** or **GroupFooter** property or both to Yes for the selected field or expression.
