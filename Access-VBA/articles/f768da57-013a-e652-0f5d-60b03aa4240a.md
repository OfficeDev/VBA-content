 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A collection of all the  ** [Workbook](8c00aa60-c974-eed3-0812-3c9625eb0d4c.md)** objects that are currently open in the Microsoft Excel application.

## Remarks

For more information about using a single  **Workbook** object, see the [Workbook](8c00aa60-c974-eed3-0812-3c9625eb0d4c.md) object.


## Example

Use the  ** [Workbooks](5291a324-87d7-3916-ffee-34c3389cea13.md)** property to return the **Workbooks** collection. The following example closes all open workbooks.


```
Workbooks.Close
```

Use the  ** [Add](ea9f2a2c-3cad-0c35-37b5-82da2f24b876.md)** method to create a new, empty workbook and add it to the collection. The following example adds a new, empty workbook to Microsoft Excel.




```
Workbooks.Add
```

Use the  ** [Open](1d1c3fca-ae1a-0a91-65a2-6f3f0fb308a0.md)** method to open a file. This creates a new workbook for the opened file. The following example opens the file Array.xls as a read-only workbook.




```
Workbooks.Open FileName:="Array.xls", ReadOnly:=True
```
