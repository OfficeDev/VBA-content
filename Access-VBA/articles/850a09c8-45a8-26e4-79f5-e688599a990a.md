# CodeProject.CloseConnection Method (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **CloseConnection** method to close the current connection between the **CodeProject**object in a Microsoft Access project (.adp) or Access database and the database specified in the project's base connection string.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **CloseConnection**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CodeProject** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **CloseConnection** method closes the current connection of the Access project, database, or data source control, frees the ADO **Connection**object, and sets the  **Connection** property to **Null**. The  **BaseConnectionString**property is left unchanged. Users are prevented from calling datasourcecontrol.Connection.Close and must use this method instead.

The  **CloseConnection** method is useful when you have opened a Microsoft Access database from another application through Automation.
