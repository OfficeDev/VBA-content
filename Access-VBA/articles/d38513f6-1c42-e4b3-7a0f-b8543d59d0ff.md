# CalloutFormat.CustomDrop Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

This distance is measured from the top of the text box unless the  ** [AutoAttach](80f5bf63-072d-1245-d564-1b54af0f85b5.md)** property is set to **True** and the text box is to the left of the origin of the callout line (the place that the callout points to), in which case the drop distance is measured from the bottom of the text box.
