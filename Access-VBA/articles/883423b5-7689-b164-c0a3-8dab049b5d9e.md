# ChartArea Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the chart area of a chart. 

## Remarks

The chart area includes everything, including the plot area. However, the plot area has its own fill, so filling the plot area does not fill the chart area.

 For information about formatting the plot area, see ** [PlotArea Object](85c42124-268c-8b0e-ba5d-c2f6fbf53e79.md)**.

Use the  **ChartArea** property to return the **ChartArea** object.


## Example

The following example turns off the border for the chart area in embedded chart 1 on the worksheet named "Sheet1."


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Chart. _ 
 ChartArea.Format.Line.Visible = False
```
