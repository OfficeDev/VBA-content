# HiLoLines Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the high-low lines in a chart group.

## Remarks

 High-low lines connect the highest point with the lowest point in every category in the chart group. Only 2-D line groups can have high-low lines. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single high-low line; you either have high-low lines turned on for all points in a chart group or you have them turned off.

If the  ** [HasHiLoLines](ea743b83-8a3c-7ce1-6659-9a25ebb8eeae.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the  **HiLoLines** object are disabled.


## Example

Use the  ** [HiLoLines](3d226065-9482-b393-a216-39d7c26961f0.md)** property to return the **HiLoLines** object. The following example uses the **HasHiLowLines** property to add HiLowLines to embedded chart one (the chart must be a line chart) on worksheet one. The example then makes the high-low lines blue.


```
Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Activate 
ActiveChart.ChartGroups(1).HasHiLoLines = True 
ActiveChart.ChartGroups(1).HiLoLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255)
```
