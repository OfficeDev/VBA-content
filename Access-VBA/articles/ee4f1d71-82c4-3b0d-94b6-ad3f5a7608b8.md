
# In Operator (Microsoft Access SQL)

Determines whether the value of an expression is equal to any of several values in a specified list.


## Syntax

 _expr_ [ **Not** ] **In(** _value1, value2, …_ **)**


## Remarks

The  **In** operator syntax has these parts:



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _expr_|Expression identifying the field that contains the data you want to evaluate.|
| _value1_, _value2_|Expression or list of expressions against which you want to evaluate  _expr_.|
If  _expr_ is found in the list of values _,_ the **In** operator returns **True**; otherwise, it returns **False**. You can include the **Not** logical operator to evaluate the opposite condition (that is, whether _expr_ is not in the list of values).

For example, you can use  **In** to determine which orders are shipped to a set of specified regions:




```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Orders 
WHERE ShipRegion In ('Avon','Glos','Som')
```


## Example

The following example uses the Orders table in the Northwind.mdb database to create a query that includes all orders shipped to Lancashire and Essex and the dates shipped. 

This example calls the EnumFields procedure, which you can find in the SELECT statement example.




```
Sub InX() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset 
 
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    ' Select records from the Orders table that 
    ' have a ShipRegion value of Lancashire or Essex. 
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT " _ 
        &amp; "CustomerID, ShippedDate FROM Orders " _ 
        &amp; "WHERE ShipRegion In " _ 
        &amp; "('Lancashire','Essex');") 
     
    ' Populate the Recordset. 
    rst.MoveLast 
     
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of 
    ' the Recordset. 
    EnumFields rst, 12 
 
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
