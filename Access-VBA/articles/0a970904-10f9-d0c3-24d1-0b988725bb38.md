# Form.DataEntry Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **DataEntry** property to specify whether a bound form opens to allow data entry only. The **Data Entry** property doesn't determine whether records can be added; it only determines whether existing records are displayed. Read/write **Boolean**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **DataEntry**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks

This property can be set in any view.

The  **DataEntry** property has an effect only when the **AllowAdditions**property is set to Yes.

Setting the  **DataEntry** property to Yes by using Visual Basic has the same effect as clicking **Data Entry** on the **Records** menu. Setting it to No by using Visual Basic is equivalent to clicking **Remove Filter/Sort** on the **Records** menu.
