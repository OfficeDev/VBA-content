You can use the  **GroupLevel** property in Visual Basic to refer to the group level you are grouping or sorting on in a report. Read-only **GroupLevel** object.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **GroupLevel**( **_Index_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Index|Required| **Long**|The group level, starting with 0. The first field or expression you group on is group level 0, the second is group level 1, and so on.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The following sample settings show how you use the  **GroupLevel** property to refer to a group level.



|**Group level**|**Refers to**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **GroupLevel**(0)|The first field or expression you sort or group on.|
| **GroupLevel**(1)|The second field or expression you sort or group on.|
| **GroupLevel**(2)|The third field or expression you sort or group on.|
The  **GroupLevel** property setting is an array in which each entry identifies a group level. You can have up to 10 group levels (0 to 9).


 **Note**  You can use this property only by using Visual Basic to set the  ** [SortOrder](2c58785c-4ddb-a581-b438-5f6390f544dd.md)**,  ** [GroupOn](7fb9551f-5742-39a2-1cf3-7b3975ae517a.md)**,  ** [GroupInterval](98ba66b9-658e-9fa6-155b-3b4f1a7c3f01.md)**,  ** [KeepTogether](65bc99df-7b0f-ec66-5add-0943ef0cd1f3.md)**, and  **ControlSource**properties. You set these properties in the  ** [Open](d170b67d-3123-6f51-6cf8-38433736f104.md)**event procedure of a report. 

In reports, you can group or sort on more than one field or expression. Each field or expression you group or sort on is a group level.

You specify the fields and expressions to sort and group on by using the  ** [CreateGroupLevel](880c1e36-b7b5-7ea4-a2ca-d7c3f0a5a7be.md)**method.

If a group is already defined for a report (the  **GroupLevel** property is set to 0), then you can use the **ControlSource** property to change the group level in the report's Open event procedure.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following code changes the  **ControlSource** property to a value contained in the `txtPromptYou`text box on the open form named  `SortForm`:


```
Private Sub Report_Open(Cancel As Integer) 
 Me.GroupLevel(0).ControlSource _ 
 = Forms!SortForm!txtPromptYou 
End Sub
```
