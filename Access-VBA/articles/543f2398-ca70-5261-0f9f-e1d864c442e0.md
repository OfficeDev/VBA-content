 [Example](#sectionSection2)


You can use the  **SubdatasheetExpanded** property to specify or determine the saved state of all subdatasheets within a table or query. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **SubdatasheetExpanded**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The default value is  **False**.

To set the  **SubdatasheetExpanded** property by using Visual Basic, you must first create the property by using the DAO **CreateProperty**method.

The  **SubdatasheetExpanded** and **SubdatasheetHeight** properties take effect on the subform control when the form is in datasheet view.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example turns subdatasheet expansion on or off for the "Purchase Orders" form. 

To try this example yourself, open a form (containing a subform) in Design view, click the Builder button next to the On Load property box in the form's property window, paste this code into the form's Form_Load event (removing the reference to the "Purchase Orders" form), and then open the form in Datasheet view.




```
Dim strExpand As String 
 
With Forms("Purchase Orders") 
 
 strExpand = InputBox("Expand subdatasheets? Y/N") 
 
 Select Case strExpand 
 Case "Y" 
 .SubdatasheetExpanded = True 
 Case "N" 
 .SubdatasheetExpanded = False 
 Case Else 
 MsgBox "Can't determine subdatasheet expansion state." 
 End Select 
 
End With
```
