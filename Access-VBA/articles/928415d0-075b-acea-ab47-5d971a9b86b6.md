 _expression_. **OnWindow**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Window** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The procedure specified by this property isn't run when other procedures switch to the window or when a command to switch to a window is received through a DDE channel. Instead, the procedure responds to the user's actions, such as clicking a window with the mouse.

If a worksheet or macro sheet has an Auto_Activate or Auto_Deactivate macro defined for it, those macros will be run after the procedure specified by the  ** [OnWindow](73ae5d34-66e6-3c1e-07f8-08850d13a4f5.md)** property.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example causes the WindowActivate procedure to be run whenever window one is activated.


```
ThisWorkbook.Windows(1).OnWindow = "WindowActivate"
```
