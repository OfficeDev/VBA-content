The  **NoData** event occurs after Microsoft Access formats a report for printing that has no data (the report is bound to an empty recordset), but before the report is printed. You can use this event to cancel printing of a blank report.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **NoData**( **_Cancel_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Cancel|Required| **Integer**|The setting determines whether to print the report. Setting the Cancel argument to **True** (-1) prevents the report from printing. You can also use the **CancelEvent** method of the **DoCmd** object to cancel printing the report.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  ** [OnNoData](5d3cfec5-1b57-625c-c350-0d7e475be2d2.md)** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

If the report isn't bound to a table or query (by using the report's  ** [RecordSource](aa3b31cc-21a6-5d56-8361-9fc232ffae97.md)** property), the **NoData** event doesn't occur.

This event occurs after the  **Format** events for the report, but before the first **Print** event.

This event doesn't occur for subreports. If you want to hide controls on a subreport when the subreport has no data, so that the controls don't print in this case, you can use the  **HasData** property in a macro or event procedure that runs when the **Format** or **Print** event occurs.

The  **NoData** event occurs before the first **Page** event for the report.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to cancel printing a report when it has no data. A message box notifying the user that the printing has been canceled is also displayed. 

To try this example, add the following event procedure to a report. Try running the report when it contains no data. 




```
Private Sub Report_NoData(Cancel As Integer) 
    MsgBox "The report has no data." &amp; _ 
         chr(13) &amp; "Printing is canceled. " &amp; _ 
         chr(13) &amp; "Check the data source for the " &amp; _ 
         chr(13) &amp; "report. Make sure you entered " &amp; _ 
         chr(13) &amp; "the correct criteria (for " &amp; _ 
         chr(13) &amp; "example, a valid range of " &amp; _ 
         chr(13) &amp; "dates),." vbOKOnly + vbInformation 
    Cancel = True 
End Sub 
```

The following example shows how to use the  **NoData** event of a report to prevent the report form opening when there is no data to be displayed.

```
Private Sub Report_NoData(Cancel As Integer)

    'Add code here that will be executed if no data
    'was returned by the Report's RecordSource
    MsgBox "No customers ordered this product this month. " &amp; _
        "The report will now close."
    Cancel = True

End Sub
```
