# DataSource Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates an object that contains data to be represented as a [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object.

## Remarks

This property is used to create data-bound controls with the Data Environment. The Data Environment maintains collections of data (data sources) containing named objects ( _data members_ ) that will be represented as a **Recordset** object _._

The [DataMember](f89e1d42-7993-764b-4e8a-2f449903f792.md) and **DataSource** properties must be used in conjunction.

The object referenced must implement the  **IDataSource** interface and must contain an **IRowset** interface.

 **Usage**




```vb
Dim rs as New ADODB.Recordset
rs.DataMember = "Command"     'Name of the rowset to bind to
Set rs.DataSource = myDE      'Name of the object containing an IRowset


```
