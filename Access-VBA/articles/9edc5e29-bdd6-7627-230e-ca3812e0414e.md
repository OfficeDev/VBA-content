# Section Object (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

A form section is part of a form such as a header, footer, or detail section.

## Remarks

You can set section properties which are attributes of a form that affect the appearance or behavior of that section. For example, you can set the  **CanGrow**property to specify whether the section will increase vertically to print all the data the section contains. Section properties are set in form Design view.
