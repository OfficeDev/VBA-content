You can use the  **InSelection** property to determine or specify whether a control on a form in Design view is selected. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **InSelection**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Section** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When a control is selected, its sizing handles are visible and it can be resized by the user. More than one control can be selected at a time.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following function uses the  **InSelection** property to determine whether the `strControlName` control on a form is selected.

To test this code, paste the IsControlSelected function code in the Declarations section of a code module in the Northwind sample database, open the Customers form in Design view, and select the CompanyName control. Then enter the following line in the Debug window:




```
? IsControlSelected (Forms!Customers, "CompanyName") 
 
Function IsControlSelected(frm As Form, _ 
 strControlName As String) As Boolean 
 Dim intI As Integer, ctl As Control 
 If frm.CurrentView <> 0 Then 
 ' Form is not in Design view. 
 Exit Function 
 Else 
 For intI = 0 To frm.Count - 1 
 Set ctl = frm(intI) 
 If ctl.InSelection = True Then 
 ' Is desired control selected? 
 If UCase(ctl.Name) = UCase(strControlName) Then 
 IsControlSelected = True 
 Exit Function 
 End If 
 Else 
 IsControlSelected = False 
 End If 
 Next intI 
 End If 
End Function
```
