## Remarks

Filters are commonly used to view a temporary subset of the records in a database. When you use a filter, you apply criteria to display only records that meet specific conditions. In an Employees form, for example, you can use a filter to display only records of employees with over 5 years of service. You can also use a filter to restrict access to records containing sensitive information, such as financial or medical data.
