 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the size of the stream in number of bytes.

## Return Values

Returns a  **Long** value that specifies the size of the stream in number of bytes. The default value is the size of the stream, or -1 if the size of the stream is not known.


## Remarks

 **Size** can be used only with open[Stream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d49b1514-e0b4-0aca-d5c2-8266f3f4fe65%28Office.15%29.aspx) objects.


 **Note**  Any number of bits can be stored in a  **Stream** object, limited only by system resources. If the **Stream** contains more bits than can be represented by a **Long** value, **Size** is truncated and therefore does not accurately represent the length of the **Stream**.
