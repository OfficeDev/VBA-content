# Minimizing Log File Space Usage

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A log file may fill quickly (thus halting the server) if there is a large volume of activity on an SQL Server database. You can set the log file to  **Truncate on Checkpoint** to significantly extend the life of the log file for a database.

 **To enable Truncate on Checkpoint in Microsoft SQL Server 6.5**

1. Start Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager, open the tree for the Server, and then open the Database Devices tree.
    
2. Double-click the name of the database on which this feature will be enabled.
    
3. From the  **Database** tab, select **Truncate**.
    
4. From the  **Options** tab, select **Truncate Log on Checkpoint**, and then click **OK**.
    
 **To enable Truncate on Checkpoint in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0**

1. Start Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager, open the tree for the Server, and then open the Databases tree.
    
2. Right-click the name of the database on which this feature will be enabled and choose  **Properties**.
    
3. From the  **Options** tab, select **Truncate Log on Checkpoint**, and then click **OK**.
    
For more information about the  **Truncate on Checkpoint** feature, see the Microsoft SQL Server documentation.
