## Syntax

## Example

This example sets the search criteria to identify the borders of cells that have a continuous and thick style bottom-edge, creates a cell with this condition, finds this cell, and notifies the user.

 ' Set the search criteria for the border of the cell format. 
 With Application.FindFormat.Borders(xlEdgeBottom) 
 .LineStyle = xlContinuous 
 .Weight = xlThick 
 End With 
 
 ' Create a continuous thick bottom-edge border for cell A5. 
 Range("A5").Select 
 With Selection.Borders(xlEdgeBottom) 
 .LineStyle = xlContinuous 
 .Weight = xlThick 
 End With 
 Range("A1").Select 
 MsgBox "Cell A5 has a continuous thick bottom-edge border" 
 
 ' Find the cells based on the search criteria. 
 Cells.Find(What:="", After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt:= _ 
 xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=False _ 
 , SearchFormat:=True).Activate
