A collection of custom workbook views.

## Remarks

 Each view is represented by a ** [CustomView](e16b1920-faeb-62d4-4d27-59745c4f5355.md)** object.


## Example

Use the  **CustomViews** property to return the **CustomViews** collection. Use the ** [Add](134d9969-048b-6a53-4f2c-cc83589c5a70.md)** method to create a new custom view and add it to the **CustomViews** collection. The following example creates a new custom view named "Summary."

```
