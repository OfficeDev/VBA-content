## Remarks

This property isn't available for radar charts. For 3-D charts, this property indicates where the plane defined by the category axis crosses the value axis.

This property can be used for both category and value axes. On the category axis,  **xlMinimum** sets the value axis to cross at the first category, and **xlMaximum** sets the value axis to cross at the last category.

Note that  **xlMinimum** and **xlMaximum** can have different meanings, depending on the axis.


## Example

This example sets the value axis to cross the category axis at the maximum x value.


```
myChart.Axes(xlCategory).Crosses = xlMaximum
```
