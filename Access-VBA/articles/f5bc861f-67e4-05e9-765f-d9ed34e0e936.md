## Remarks

Deleting a  **Point** or **LegendKey** object deletes the entire series.


## Example

This example deletes cells A1:D10 on the datasheet and shifts the remaining cells to the left.

Set mySheet = myChart.Application.DataSheet 
mySheet.Range("A1:D10").Delete Shift:=xlShiftToLeft
```

This example deletes the chart title.




```
myChart.ChartTitle.Delete
