# Databar.SetFirstPriority Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SetFirstPriority**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Databar** object.


## Remarks

When you have multiple conditional formatting rules in a worksheet, if the rule was not previously set to priority "1", this method will cause the priority of all other existing rules on the worksheet to be increased by one.


 **Note**  Priority levels for conditional formatting rules are applied on a worksheet-level basis.
