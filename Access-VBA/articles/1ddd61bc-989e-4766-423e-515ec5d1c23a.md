 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains methods and properties that pertain to speech.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [Speech](981d5eef-55ff-54ee-a3ca-f009a6a575da.md)** property of the ** [Application](19b73597-5cf9-4f56-8227-b5211f657f6f.md)** object to return a ** [Speech](1ddd61bc-989e-4766-423e-515ec5d1c23a.md)** object.


## Example

Once a  **Speech** object is returned, you can use the ** [Speak](d17dcf63-c837-a5b5-8267-44767b38700a.md)** method of **Speech** object to play back the contents of a string. In the following example, Microsoft Excel plays back "Hello". This example assumes speech features have been installed on the host system.


 **Note**  There is a speech feature in the setup tree that pertains to Dictation and Command &amp; Control that does not have to be installed.


```
Sub UseSpeech() 
 
 Application.Speech.Speak "Hello" 
 
End Sub()
```
