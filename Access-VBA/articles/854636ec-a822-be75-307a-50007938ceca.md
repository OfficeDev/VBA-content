# TabControl.HoverForeShade Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Gets or sets the shade applied to the theme color in the  **HoverForeColor** property of the specified object. Read/write **Single**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **HoverForeShade**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **TabControl** object.


## Remarks

The  **HoverForeShade** property contains a numeric expression that can be used to darken the theme color in the **HoverForeColor** property. The default value of the **HoverForeShade** property is 100, which is neutral, and does not change the theme color. To darken the color, first determine the percentage by which to darken from 1 to 100, then subtract that value as a whole number from 100 and use the remainder. For example, to darken the theme color shade by 75%, subtract 75 from 100 and use the remainder, which is 25.

This property is not surfaced in the property sheet.
