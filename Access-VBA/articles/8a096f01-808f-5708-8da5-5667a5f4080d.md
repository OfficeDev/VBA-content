# Gridlines Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents major or minor gridlines on a chart axis.

## Remarks

 Gridlines extend the tick marks on a chart axis to make it easier to see the values associated with the data markers. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single gridline; you either have all gridlines for an axis turned on or all of them turned off.

Use the  ** [MajorGridlines](618f880a-2b5d-2357-3c85-7b4858723b28.md)** property to return the **GridLines** object that represents the major gridlines for the axis. Use the ** [MinorGridlines](5725fdb3-05de-e555-5734-cbc64c6a2068.md)** property to return the **GridLines** object that represents the minor gridlines. It's possible to return both major and minor gridlines at the same time.


## Example

The following example turns on major gridlines for the category axis on the chart sheet named "Chart1" and then formats the gridlines to be blue dashed lines.


```
With Charts("chart1").Axes(xlCategory) 
 .HasMajorGridlines = True 
 .MajorGridlines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
 .MajorGridlines.Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
End With
```
