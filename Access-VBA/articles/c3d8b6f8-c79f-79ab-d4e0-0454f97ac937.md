The following example shows how to use the  **IsTrusted** property in a macro to determine whether the database has been opened with trust enabled. If trust has been enabled, the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) subroutine **Init** is called. Otherwise, the use is notified that the database has been opened in disabled mode.
