 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a variable that be used in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code or from a macro. 

## Remarks

A  **TempVar** objects provide a convenient way to exchange data between VBA procedures and macros.

Although a  **TempVar** object can be used to store information for use in VBA procedures, it does not have the same funcitonality as a VBA variable.


- By default, a  **TempVar** object remains in memory until Access is closed. You can use the ** [Remove](a9ab9ff2-5bfc-d001-f5eb-9929907bc1b2.md)** method or the [RemoveTempVar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7bcc5010-3e30-ecef-2c5d-a35e73c8e325%28Office.15%29.aspx) macro action to remove a **TempVar** object.
    
- In VBA, a  **TempVar** object is accessible only to the members of the Access ** [Application](aefb0713-97e6-e2c7-e530-8fd2e1316a55.md)** object, referenced databases, or add-ins.
    
- A  **TempVar** object can store only text or numeric data. **TempVar** objects cannot store objects.
    
To refer to a  **TempVar** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use the following syntax form:


-  **TempVar**![name]
