[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[ Example](#sectionSection2)


Deletes an existing table, procedure, or view from a database, or deletes an existing index from a table.

 **Note**  The Microsoft Access database engine does not support the use of DROP, or any of the DDL statements, with non-Microsoft Access database engine databases. Use the DAO  **Delete** method instead.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

DROP {TABLE  _table_ | INDEX _index_ ON _table_ | PROCEDURE _procedure_ | VIEW _view_ }

The DROP statement has these parts:



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _table_|The name of the table to be deleted or the table from which an index is to be deleted.|
| _procedure_|The name of the procedure to be deleted.|
| _view_|The name of the view to be deleted.|
| _index_|The name of the index to be deleted from  _table._|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You must close the table before you can delete it or remove an index from it.

You can also use [ALTER TABLE](78e6c92c-e88c-e55f-6b89-435360c166a6.md) to delete an index from a table.

You can use [CREATE TABLE](fc45d36e-6e43-c030-5016-cca8bb1379fe.md) to create a table and[CREATE INDEX](c5919ef4-a08d-df06-7078-5331adbcb45c.md) or ALTER TABLE to create an index. To modify a table, use ALTER TABLE.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example assumes the existence of a hypothetical NewIndex index on the Employees table in the Northwind database.

This example deletes the index MyIndex from the Employees table.




```vb
Sub DropX1() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database 
 
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    ' Delete NewIndex from the Employees table. 
    dbs.Execute "DROP INDEX NewIndex ON Employees;" 
 
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```

This example deletes the Employees table from the database.




```vb
Sub DropX2() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database 
 
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    ' Delete the Employees table. 
    dbs.Execute "DROP TABLE Employees;" 
 
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
