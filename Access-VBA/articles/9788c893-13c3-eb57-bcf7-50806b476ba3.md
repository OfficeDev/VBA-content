Returns a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object that represents all the cells on the active worksheet. If the active document is not a worksheet, this property fails.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Cells**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Because the  ** [Item](f7d40273-5069-8a9d-14ee-19df225f864c.md)** property is the default property for the **Range** object, you can specify the row and column index immediately after the **Cells** keyword. For more information, see the **Item** property and the examples for this topic.

Using this property without an object qualifier returns a  **Range** object that represents all the cells on the active worksheet.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

 **Sample code provided by:** Tom Urtis, [Atlas Programming Management](http://www.atlaspm.com/)

This example looks at data in each row and inserts a blank row each time the value in column A changes.




```
Sub ChangeInsertRows()
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Dim xRow As Long
    
    For xRow = Application.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row To 3 Step -1
        If Application.Cells(xRow, 1).Value <> Application.Cells(xRow - 1, 1).Value Then Rows(xRow).Resize(1).Insert
    Next xRow
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```
