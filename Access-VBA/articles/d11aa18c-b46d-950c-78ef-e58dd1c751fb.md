|XlColorIndex can be one of these XlColorIndex constants.|

 _expression_. **PatternColorIndex**
 _expression_ Required. An expression that returns one of the objects in the Applies To list.

## Remarks

Set this property to  **xlColorIndexAutomatic** to specify the automatic pattern for cells or the automatic fill style for drawing objects. Set this property to **xlColorIndexNone** to specify that you don't want a pattern (this is the same as setting the **Pattern** property of the **Interior** object to **xlPatternNone**).

```
myChart.ChartArea.Interior.PatternColorIndex = 5
```
