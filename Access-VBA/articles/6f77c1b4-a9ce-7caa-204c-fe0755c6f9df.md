A  **Report** object refers to a particular Microsoft Access report.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

A  **Report** object is a member of the **Reports** collection, which is a collection of all currently open reports. Within the **Reports** collection, individual reports are indexed beginning with zero. You can refer to an individual **Report** object in the **Reports** collection either by referring to the report by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If the report name includes a space, the name must be surrounded by brackets ([ ]).



|**Syntax**|**Example**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Reports**!reportname|Reports!OrderReport|
| **Reports**![report name]|Reports![Order Report]|
| **Reports**("reportname")|Reports("OrderReport")|
| **Reports**(index)|Reports(0)|

 **Note**  Each  **Report** object has a **Controls** collection, which contains all controls on the report. You can refer to a control on a report either by implicitly or explicitly referring to the **Controls** collection. Your code will be faster if you refer to the **Controls** collection implicitly. The following examples show two of the ways you might refer to a control named **NewData** on a report called **OrderReport**. 


```
' Implicit reference. 
Reports!OrderReport!NewData
```


```
' Explicit reference. 
Reports!OrderReport.Controls!NewData
```


## Example
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **NoData** event of a report to prevent the report form opening when there is no data to be displayed.

 **Sample code provided by:** The [Microsoft Access 2010 Programmer's Reference](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Access-2010-Programmer-s-Reference.productCd-0470591668.mdl)




```
Private Sub Report_NoData(Cancel As Integer)

    'Add code here that will be executed if no data
    'was returned by the Report's RecordSource
    MsgBox "No customers ordered this product this month. " &amp; _
        "The report will now close."
    Cancel = True

End Sub
```

The following example shows how to use the  **Page** event to add a watermark to a report before it is printed.




```
Private Sub Report_Page()
    Dim strWatermarkText As String
    Dim sizeHor As Single
    Dim sizeVer As Single

#If RUN_PAGE_EVENT = True Then
    With Me
        '// Print page border
        Me.Line (0, 0)-(.ScaleWidth - 1, .ScaleHeight - 1), vbBlack, B
    
        '// Print watermark
        strWatermarkText = "Confidential"
        
        .ScaleMode = 3
        .FontName = "Segoe UI"
        .FontSize = 48
        .ForeColor = RGB(255, 0, 0)

        '// Calculate text metrics
        sizeHor = .TextWidth(strWatermarkText)
        sizeVer = .TextHeight(strWatermarkText)
        
        '// Set the print location
        .CurrentX = (.ScaleWidth / 2) - (sizeHor / 2)
        .CurrentY = (.ScaleHeight / 2) - (sizeVer / 2)
    
        '// Print the watermark
        .Print strWatermarkText
    End With
#End If

End Sub
```

The following example shows how to set the  **BackColor** property of a control based on its value.




```
Private Sub SetControlFormatting()
    If (Me.AvgOfRating >= 8) Then
        Me.AvgOfRating.BackColor = vbGreen
    ElseIf (Me.AvgOfRating >= 5) Then
        Me.AvgOfRating.BackColor = vbYellow
    Else
        Me.AvgOfRating.BackColor = vbRed
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub Detail_Format(Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integer)
    ' size the width of the rectangle
    Dim lngOffset As Long
    lngOffset = (Me.boxInside.Left - Me.boxOutside.Left) * 2
    Me.boxInside.Width = (Me.boxOutside.Width * (Me.AvgOfRating / 10)) - lngOffset
    
    ' do conditional formatting for the control in print preview
    SetControlFormatting
End Sub

Private Sub Detail_Paint()
    ' do conditional formatting for the control in report view
    SetControlFormatting
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to format a report to show progress bars. The example uses a pair of rectangle controls,  **boxInside** and **boxOutside**, to create a progress bar based on the value of  **AvgOfRating**. The progress bars are visible only when the report is opened in  **Print Preview** mode or it is printed.




```
Private Sub Report_Load()
    If (Me.CurrentView = AcCurrentView.acCurViewPreview) Then
        Me.boxInside.Visible = True
        Me.boxOutside.Visible = True
    Else
        Me.boxInside.Visible = False
        Me.boxOutside.Visible = False
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub Detail_Format(Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integer)
    ' size the width of the rectangle
    Dim lngOffset As Long
    lngOffset = (Me.boxInside.Left - Me.boxOutside.Left) * 2
    Me.boxInside.Width = (Me.boxOutside.Width * (Me.AvgOfRating / 10)) - lngOffset
    
    ' do conditional formatting for the control in print preview
    SetControlFormatting
End Sub
```
