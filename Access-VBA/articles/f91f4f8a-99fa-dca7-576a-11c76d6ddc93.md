Under some circumstances, you may want to include code in an event procedure that cancels the associated event. For example, you may want to include code that cancels the  ** [Open](8638E6D9-29AF-A007-44F5-9BADA14ADB29.md)** event in an **Open** event procedure for a form, preventing the form from opening if certain conditions are not met.

You can cancel the following events:


| **ApplyFilter**|
| **BeforeDelConfirm**|
| **BeforeInsert**|
| **BeforeRender**|
| **BeforeUpdate**|
| **CommandBeforeExecute**|
| **DblClick**|
| **Delete**|
| **Dirty**|
| **Exit**|
| **Filter**|
| **NoData**|
| **Open**|
| **Undo**|
| **Unload**|
You cancel an event by setting an event procedure's  _Cancel_ argument to **True**.
