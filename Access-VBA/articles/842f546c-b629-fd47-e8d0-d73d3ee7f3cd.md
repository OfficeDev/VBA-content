## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **Follow** method has the same effect as clicking a hyperlink.

You can include the  **Follow** method in an event procedure if you want to open a hyperlink in response to a user action. For example, you may want to open a web page with reference information when a user opens a particular form.

When you use the  **Follow** method, you don't need to know the address specified by a control's **HyperlinkAddress** property. You only need to know the name of the control that contains the hyperlink. Conversely, when you use the ** [FollowHyperlink](b5142ca6-8d67-c42b-81a4-5417265a50b0.md)** method, you need to specify the address for the particular hyperlink you wish to follow.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example sets the  **HyperlinkAddress** property of a command button and then opens the hyperlink when the form is loaded.

To try this example, create a form and add a command button named Command0. Paste the following code into the form's module and switch to Form view:




```
Private Sub Form_Load() 
    Dim ctl As CommandButton 
 
    Set ctl = Me!Command0 
    With ctl 
        .Visible = False 
        .HyperlinkAddress = "http://www.microsoft.com/" 
        .Hyperlink.Follow 
    End With 
End Sub
```
