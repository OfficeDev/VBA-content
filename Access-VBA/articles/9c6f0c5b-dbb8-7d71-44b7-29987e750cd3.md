# Walls Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the walls of a 3-D chart. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single wall; you must return all the walls as a unit.

## Example

Use the  ** [Walls](fbee1165-7602-4d77-e5b6-8a127783c96e.md)** property to return the **Walls** object. The following example sets the pattern on the walls for embedded chart one on Sheet1. If the chart isn't a 3-D chart, this example will fail.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Chart _ 
 .Walls.Interior.Pattern = xlGray75
```
