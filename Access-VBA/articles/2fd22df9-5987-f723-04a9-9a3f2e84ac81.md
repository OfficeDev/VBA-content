# PageSetup Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the page setup description.

## Remarks

 The **PageSetup** object contains all page setup attributes (left margin, bottom margin, paper size, and so on) as properties.


## Example

Use the  ** [PageSetup](50310e49-49d0-c8c6-ed23-0eacae6355b5.md)** property to return a **PageSetup** object. The following example sets the orientation to landscape mode and then prints the worksheet.


```
With Worksheets("Sheet1") 
 .PageSetup.Orientation = xlLandscape 
 .PrintOut 
End With
```

The  **With** statement makes it easier and faster to set several properties at the same time. The following example sets all the margins for worksheet one.




```
With Worksheets(1).PageSetup 
 .LeftMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.5) 
 .RightMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.75) 
 .TopMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(1.5) 
 .BottomMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(1) 
 .HeaderMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.5) 
 .FooterMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.5) 
End With
```
