# Filter Object (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a filter for a single column.

## Remarks

 The **Filter** object is a member of the ** [Filters](a714ed69-7772-5ade-3acd-f3e3d98db62c.md)** collection. The **Filters** collection contains all the filters in an autofiltered range.


## Example

Use  ** [Filters](4a22dcab-4d06-01a8-7811-4590cf28f506.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the filter title or index number, to return a single **Filter** object. The following example sets a variable to the value of the ** [On](3e325750-2fdc-631f-e116-90769958366c.md)** property of the filter for the first column in the filtered range on the Crew worksheet.


```
Set w = Worksheets("Crew") 
If w.AutoFilterMode Then 
 filterIsOn = w.AutoFilter.Filters(1).On 
End If
```

Note that all the properties of the  **Filter** object are read-only. To set these properties, apply autofiltering manually or using the ** [AutoFilter](0f773dbf-63e8-f714-d246-f803a74d366c.md)** method of the ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object, as shown in the following example.




```
Set w = Worksheets("Crew") 
w.Cells.AutoFilter field:=2, Criteria1:="Crucial", _ 
 Operator:=xlOr, Criteria2:="Important"
```
