 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


You can use this property to determine the distance in twips from the left side of the current section to the left side of the form. Read/write  **Integer**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CurrentSectionLeft**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Form** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **CurrentSectionLeft** property setting changes whenever a user scrolls through a form.

For forms whose  ** [DefaultView](bb44eca9-1576-794a-0558-f67e2d37559b.md)**property is set to Single Form, if the user scrolls to the right of the left edge of the form, the property setting is a negative value.

The  **CurrentSectionLeft** property is useful for finding the positions of detail sections displayed in Form view as continuous forms or in Datasheet view.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example displays the  **CurrentSectionLeft** and **CurrentSectionTop** property settings for a control on a continuous form. Whenever the user moves to a new record, the property settings for the current section are displayed in the `lblStatus` label in the form's header.


```
Private Sub Form_Current() 
 
 Dim intCurTop As Integer 
 Dim intCurLeft As Integer 
 
 intCurTop = Me.CurrentSectionTop 
 intCurLeft = Me.CurrentSectionLeft 
 Me!lblStatus.Caption = intCurLeft &amp; " , " &amp; intCurTop 
 
End Sub
```
