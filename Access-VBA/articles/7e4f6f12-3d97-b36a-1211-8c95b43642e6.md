# ComboBox.ItemsSelected Property (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **ItemsSelected** property to return a read-only reference to the hidden **ItemsSelected** collection. This hidden collection can be used to access data in the selected rows of a multiselect combo box control.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ItemsSelected**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The  **ItemsSelected** collection is unlike other collections in that it is a collection of **Variants** rather than of objects. Each **Variant** is an integer index referring to a selected row in a list box or combo box.

Use the  **ItemsSelected** collection in conjunction with the **Column**property or the  **ItemData**property to retrieve data from selected rows in a list box or combo box. You can list the  **ItemsSelected** collection by using the **For Each...Next** statement.

For example, if you have an Employees list box on a form, you can list the  **ItemsSelected** collection and use the control's **ItemData** property to return the value of the bound column for each selected row in the list box.

The  **ItemsSelected** collection has no methods and two properties, the **Count**and  **Item**properties.
