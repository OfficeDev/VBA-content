## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **BatchSize**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **BatchSize** property determines the batch size used when sending statements to the server in a batch update. The value of the property determines the number of statements sent to the server in one command buffer. By default, 15 statements are sent to the server in each batch. This property can be changed at any time. If a database server doesn't support statement batching, you can set this property to 1, causing each statement to be sent separately.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **BatchSize** and **UpdateOptions** properties to control aspects of any batch updating for the specified Recordset object.


```vb
Sub BatchSizeX() 
 
 Dim wrkMain As Workspace 
 Dim conMain As Connection 
 Dim rstTemp As Recordset 
 
 Set wrkMain = CreateWorkspace("ODBCWorkspace", _ 
 "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
 ' This DefaultCursorDriver setting is required for 
 ' batch updating. 
 wrkMain.DefaultCursorDriver = dbUseClientBatchCursor 
 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 Set conMain = wrkMain.OpenConnection("Publishers", _ 
 dbDriverNoPrompt, False, _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
 
 ' The following locking argument is required for 
 ' batch updating. 
 Set rstTemp = conMain.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "SELECT * FROM roysched", dbOpenDynaset, 0, _ 
 dbOptimisticBatch) 
 
 With rstTemp 
 ' Increase the number of statements sent to the server 
 ' during a single batch update, thereby reducing the 
 ' number of times an update would have to access the 
 ' server. 
 .BatchSize = 25 
 
 ' Change the UpdateOptions property so that the WHERE 
 ' clause of any batched statements going to the server 
 ' will include any updated columns in addition to the 
 ' key column(s). Also, any modifications to records 
 ' will be made by deleting the original record 
 ' and adding a modified version rather than just 
 ' modifying the original record. 
 .UpdateOptions = dbCriteriaModValues + _ 
 dbCriteriaDeleteInsert 
 
 ' Engage in batch updating using the new settings 
 ' above. 
 ' ... 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 conMain.Close 
 wrkMain.Close 
 
End Sub
```
