# Create Alternating Row Colors on a Report

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Access 2013_

By default, Access formats each row of a report's detail section with the same background color. When printing a report, shading every other line of the detail section can make it much easier to read. You can use the  ** [AlternateBackColor](A99C84E3-FA34-3A29-9F5A-E52032671E82.md)** property to specify a color to be displayed or printed on every other line in the detail section when viewing or printing a report.

The following example illustrates how to display light gray bars on every other line of the report's detail section when it is printed.



```
Private Sub Detail_Print(Cancel As Integer, PrintCount As Integer) 
 
    Me.Section("Detail").AlternateBackColor = RGB(240, 240, 240) 
     
End Sub
```
