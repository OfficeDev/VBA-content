 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **DrawMode** property to specify how the pen (the color used in drawing) interacts with existing background colors on a report when the ** [Line](9e640e37-c055-3dc3-b70e-0805cdc13561.md)**,  ** [Circle](4f5d24e2-75bf-3586-7e0d-0902adee61a6.md)**, or  ** [Pset](951a262b-b17b-9b95-b5f2-922d4aff9ce9.md)**method is used to draw on a report when printing. Read/write  **Integer**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **DrawMode**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Report** object.


## Remarks

The  **DrawMode** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|1|Black pen color.|
|2|The inverse of setting 15 (NotMergePen).|
|3|The combination of the colors common to the background color and the inverse of the pen (MaskNotPen).|
|4|The inverse of setting 13 (NotCopyPen).|
|5|The combination of the colors common to both the pen and the inverse of the display (MaskPenNot).|
|6|The inverse of the display color (Invert).|
|7|The combination of the colors in the pen and in the display color, but not in both (XorPen).|
|8|The inverse of setting 9 (NotMaskPen).|
|9|The combination of the colors common to both the pen and the display (MaskPen).|
|10|The inverse of setting 7 (NotXorPen).|
|11|No operation â€” the output remains unchanged. In effect, this setting turns drawing off (Nop).|
|12|The combination of the display color and the inverse of the pen color (MergeNotPen).|
|13|(Default) The color specified by the  **ForeColor**property (CopyPen).|
|14|The combination of the pen color and the inverse of the display color (MergePenNot).|
|15|The combination of the pen color and the display color (MergePen).|
|16|White pen color.|
You can set the  **DrawMode** property in an event procedure specified by a section's **OnPrint**property setting.

Use this property to produce visual effects when drawing on a report. Microsoft Access compares each pixel in the draw pattern to the corresponding pixel in the existing background to determine how the drawing appears on the report. For example, setting 7 uses the  **Xor** operator to combine a draw-pattern pixel with a background pixel.
