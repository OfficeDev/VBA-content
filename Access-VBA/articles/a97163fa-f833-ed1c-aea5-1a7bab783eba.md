# SharedResource Object (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a Microsoft Office theme or image that is available as a shared resource in the database.

## Remarks

A shared recource is stored once in the database, but can be used many times. For example, you may want to display your company logo on every form that you create. In earlier versions of Access, you had to import the logo into every form. In Access, you can add the logo as a shared image. Then , it will be displayed in the  **Image Gallery** that is displayed when you click the **Insert Image** dropdown menu for the **Controls** group in the **Design** tab.

To import an image as a  **SharedResource** object, use the ** [AddSharedImage](7e1e0455-65e0-820e-e25c-17989a40000b.md)** method of the ** [CodeProject](70b71f57-df23-2cf7-23f5-147053a8ec26.md)** object or the ** [AddSharedImage](c6c02f12-6c5f-852a-65b7-a0ffbb3346fd.md)** method of the ** [CurrentProject](e6baae73-1eeb-b48f-d35e-b3e921378561.md)** object.
