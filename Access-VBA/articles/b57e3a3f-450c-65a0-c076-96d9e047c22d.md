An option button on a form or report is a stand-alone control used to display a Yes/No value from an underlying record source


## Remarks

When you select or clear an option button that's bound to a Yes/No field, Microsoft Access displays the value in the underlying table according to the field's  **Format** property (Yes/No, **True** / **False**, or On/Off).

You can also use option buttons in an option group to display values to choose from.

It's also possible to use an unbound option button in a custom dialog box to accept user input.
