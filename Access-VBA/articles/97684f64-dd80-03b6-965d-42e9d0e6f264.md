## Syntax

 _expression_. **DDETerminate**( **_ChanNum_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ChanNum|Required| **Variant**|A channel number to close, refers to a channel opened by the  ** [DDEInitiate](7b05c3ad-574e-d904-5d50-ff646486ef07.md)**function.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

For example, if you've opened a DDE channel to transfer data between Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access, you can use the  **DDETerminate** statement to close that channel once the transfer is complete.

If the channum argument isn't an integer corresponding to an open channel, a run-time error occurs.

Once a channel is closed, any subsequent DDE functions or statements performed on that channel cause a run-time error.

The  **DDETerminate** statement has no effect on active DDE link expressions in fields on forms or reports.

If you need to manipulate another application's objects from Microsoft Access, you may want to consider using Automation.
