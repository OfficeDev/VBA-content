 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **CurrentData** object refers to the objects stored in the current database by the source (server) application.

## Remarks

The  **CurrentData** object has several collections that contain specific ** [AccessObject](8a770b33-5bff-120a-6707-ca214ee5ced3.md)**objects within the current database. The following table lists the name of each collection defined by the database and the types of objects it contains.



|**Collections**|**Object type**|**Available in Access database **|**Available in Access Project (.adp)**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| ** [AllTables](530bff2d-1d0b-4790-a0f4-ffc628e7f130.md)**|All tables|Yes|Yes|
| ** [AllFunctions](1420cf24-906e-7b65-29f3-29a28cdf92cf.md)**|All functions|No|Yes|
| ** [AllQueries](9b67f04c-2642-0dcc-2a64-8ca8fa7249b3.md)**|All queries |Yes|Yes|
| ** [AllViews](f56bee24-a972-fbdf-f74a-0ac83825e3bb.md)**|All views |No|Yes|
| ** [AllStoredProcedures](896f4c2c-273c-2849-0f06-d75fa515c44a.md)**|All stored procedures |No|Yes|
| ** [AllDatabaseDiagrams](417427aa-1783-29da-30c9-66a7032a0088.md)**|All database diagrams |No|Yes|

 **Note**  The collections in the preceding table contain all of the respective objects in the database regardless if they are opened or closed.

For example, an  **AccessObject** representing a table is a member of the **AllTables** collection, which is a collection of **AccessObject** objects within the current database. Within the **AllTables** collection, individual tables are indexed beginning with zero. You can refer to an individual **AccessObject** object in the **AllTables** collection either by referring to the table by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If you want to refer to a specific item in the **AllTables** collection, it's better to refer to it by name because the item's index may change. If the object name includes a space, the name must be surrounded by brackets ([ ]).



|**Syntax**|**Example**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **AllTables**!tablename|AllTables!OrderTable|
| **AllTables**![table name]|AllTables![Order Table]|
| **AllTables**("tablename")|AllTables("OrderTable")|
| **AllTables**(index)|AllTables(0)|
