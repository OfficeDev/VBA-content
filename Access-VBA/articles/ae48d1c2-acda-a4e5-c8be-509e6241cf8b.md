
# Record is table <name> is locked by another user. (Error 3330)

The row or page that you are trying to update is currently locked by another user. The Microsoft Access database engine allows users to have the database opened in a mode that allows for row-level locking. That mode can substantially reduce the number of times this error is generated.
