# LookupRecord Data Block (Access custom web app)
A  **LookupRecord** data block performs a set of actions on a specific record.

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

 **Note**  The  **LookupRecord** data block is available only in Data Macros.


## Setting

The  **SetField** action has the following arguments.



|**Argument**|**Required**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _In_|Yes|A string that identifies the record to operate on. The  _In_ argument can contain the name of the table, a select query, or a SQL statement.|
| _Where Condition_|No|A string expression used to restrict the range of data on which the  **LookupRecord** data block is performed. For example, criteria is often equivalent to the WHERE clause in an SQL expression, without the word WHERE. If criteria is omitted, the **LookupRecord** data block operates on the entire domain specified by the _In_ argument. Any field that is included in criteria must also be a field in _In_.|
| _Alias_|No|A string that provides an alternative name for the record specified by the  _In_ argument. Often used to shorten the table name for subsequent references to prevent possible ambiguous references. If _Alias_ is not specified, the table or query name will be used as the alias.|

## Remarks

If the criteria specified by the  _In_ and _Where Condition_ arguments specifies more than one record, then the **LookupRecord** data block will only operate on the first record.

If no record satisfies  _Where Condition_ or if _In_ contains no records, then **LookupRecord** creates a blank record in which all of the fields contain a **Null** value.
