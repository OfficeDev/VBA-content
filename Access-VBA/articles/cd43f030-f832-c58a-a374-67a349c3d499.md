 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

You can use the  **BorderColor** property to specify the color of a control's border. Read/write **Long**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **BorderColor**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Attachment** object.


## Remarks

The  **BorderColor** property setting is a numeric expression that corresponds to the color you want to use for a control's border.

You can set the default for this property by using a control's default control style or the  **DefaultControl**property in Visual Basic.

A control's border color is visible only when its  **SpecialEffect**property is set to Flat or Shadowed. If the  **SpecialEffect** property is set to something other than Flat or Shadowed, setting the **BorderColor** property changes the **SpecialEffect** property setting to Flat.
