# Refer to Sheets by Index Number

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

An index number is a sequential number assigned to a sheet, based on the position of its sheet tab (counting from the left) among sheets of the same type. The following procedure uses the  ** [Worksheets](8b7d660d-ca49-0bd0-dc57-64defa47bd5e.md)**property to activate the first worksheet in the active workbook.



```
Sub FirstOne() 
 Worksheets(1).Activate 
End Sub
```

If you want to work with all types of sheets (worksheets, charts, modules, and dialog sheets), use the  ** [Sheets](45e4e19e-55ea-9615-231d-9435ba6d5a63.md)**property. The following procedure activates sheet four in the workbook.



```
Sub FourthOne() 
 Sheets(4).Activate 
End Sub
```


 **Note**  The index order can change if you move, add, or delete sheets.
