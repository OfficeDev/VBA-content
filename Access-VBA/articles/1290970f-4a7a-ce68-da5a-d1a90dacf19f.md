Returns a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)**object that represents the selected cells on the worksheet in the specified window even if a graphic object is active or selected on the worksheet. Read-only.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RangeSelection**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Window** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When a graphic object is selected on a worksheet, the  **Selection** property returns the graphic object instead of a **Range** object; the **RangeSelection** property returns the range of cells that was selected before the graphic object was selected.

This property and the  **Selection** property return identical values when a range (not a graphic object) is selected on the worksheet.

If the active sheet in the specified window isn't a worksheet, this property fails.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example displays the address of the selected cells on the worksheet in the active window.


```
MsgBox ActiveWindow.RangeSelection.Address
```
