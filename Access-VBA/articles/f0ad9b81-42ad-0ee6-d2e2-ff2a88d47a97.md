# ShapeRange.Group Method (Excel)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Groups the shapes in the specified range.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Group**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ShapeRange** object.


### Return Value

A  ** [Shape](8f01fcd1-b7d9-5216-2de5-40fb6648a403.md)** object that represents the grouped shape.


## Remarks

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single shape, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  ** [Shapes](f9c6548c-d028-1b70-a11c-c4b45ff19177.md)** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.

The  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object must be a single cell in the PivotTable field's data range. If you attempt to apply this method to more than one cell, it will fail (without displaying an error message).
