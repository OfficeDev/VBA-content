You can use the  **On Error GoTo** statement to trap errors and direct procedure flow to the location of error-handling statements within a procedure. For example, the following statement directs the flow to the label line:




```
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
```

Be sure to give each error handler label in a procedure a unique name that will not conflict with any other element in the procedure, and make sure you append a colon to the name. Within the procedure, place the  **Exit Sub** or **Exit Function** statement in front of the error handler label so that the procedure doesn't run the error-checking code if no error occurs.



```
Sub CausesAnError() 
    ' Direct procedure flow. 
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler 
    ' Raise division by zero error. 
    Err.Raise 11 
    Exit Sub 
 
ErrorHandler: 
    ' Display error information. 
    MsgBox "Error number " &amp; Err.Number &amp; ": " &amp; Err.Description 
    ' Resume with statement following occurrence of error. 
    Resume Next 
End Sub
```

The  **Raise** method of the **Err** object generates the specified error. The **Number** property of the **Err** object returns the number corresponding to the most recent run-time error; the **Description** property returns the corresponding message text for a given error.

 **Note**
