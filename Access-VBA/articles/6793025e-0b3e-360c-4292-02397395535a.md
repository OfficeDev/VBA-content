# HiLoLines Object

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the high-low lines in the specified chart group. High-low lines connect the highest point with the lowest point in every category in the chart group. Only 2-D line groups can have high-low lines. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single high-low line; either you have high-low lines turned on for all points in a chart group or you have them turned off.

## Using the HiLoLines Object

Use the  **HiLoLines** property to return the **HiLoLines** object. The following example makes the high-low lines in chart group one in the chart blue.


```
myChart.ChartGroups(1).HiLoLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255)
```


## Remarks

If the  ** [HasHiLoLines](57018e82-acf1-039f-3fa5-d2319385c3d5.md)**property is  **False**, most properties of the  **HiLoLines** object are disabled.
