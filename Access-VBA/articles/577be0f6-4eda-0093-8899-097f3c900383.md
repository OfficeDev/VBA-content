 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a slicer in a workbook.

## Remarks

Each  **Slicer** object represents a slicer in a workbook. Slicers are used to filter data in PivotTable reports or OLAP data sources.

Use the  ** [Add](f2632dee-e8fb-440c-cad8-2dd2f7e37739.md)** method to add a **Slicer** object to the ** [Slicers](12b67ff5-cf66-35d1-2c72-9aa2f4a396a0.md)** collection. To access the **SlicerItem** object that represents the currently selected button in a slicer, use the ** [ActiveItem](ecf95cb2-fb1e-97fc-46a1-2ddcf784a089.md)** property of the **Slicer** object.


## Example

The following code example changes the caption for the first slicer in the first slicer cache to "My Slicer".


```
ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches(1).Slicers(1).Caption = "My Slicer"
```

The following code example sets the width of the first slicer in the first slicer cache to equal 200 points.




```
ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches(1).Slicers(1).Width = 200
```
