 [Example](#sectionSection2)


You can use the  **FontName** property to specify the font for text in the following situations:


- When displaying or printing controls on forms and reports.
    
- When using the  ** [Print](6f8523cc-7b17-ec27-e2c9-a7ae3d5a8c3f.md)**method on a report.
    
Read/write  **String**.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **FontName**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **NavigationButton** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **FontName** property setting is the name of the font that the text is displayed in.

You can set the default for this property by using a control's default control style or the  **DefaultControl**property in Visual Basic.

For reports, you can set this property only in an event procedure or in a macro specified by the  **OnPrint**event property setting.

Font availability depends on your system and printer. If you select a font that your system can't display or that isn't installed, Windows substitutes a similar font.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example uses the  **Print** method to display text on a report named Report1. It uses the **TextWidth** and **TextHeight** methods to center the text vertically and horizontally.


```
Private Sub Detail_Format(Cancel As Integer, _ 
 FormatCount As Integer) 
 Dim rpt as Report 
 Dim strMessage As String 
 Dim intHorSize As Integer, intVerSize As Integer 
 
 Set rpt = Me 
 strMessage = "DisplayMessage" 
 With rpt 
 'Set scale to pixels, and set FontName and 
 'FontSize properties. 
 .ScaleMode = 3 
 .FontName = "Courier" 
 .FontSize = 24 
 End With 
 ' Horizontal width. 
 intHorSize = Rpt.TextWidth(strMessage) 
 ' Vertical height. 
 intVerSize = Rpt.TextHeight(strMessage) 
 ' Calculate location of text to be displayed. 
 Rpt.CurrentX = (Rpt.ScaleWidth/2) - (intHorSize/2) 
 Rpt.CurrentY = (Rpt.ScaleHeight/2) - (intVerSize/2) 
 ' Print text on Report object. 
 Rpt.Print strMessage 
End Sub
```
