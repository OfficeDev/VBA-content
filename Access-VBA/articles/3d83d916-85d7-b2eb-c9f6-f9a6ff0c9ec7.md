# Label Object (Access)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

This object corresponds to a label control. Labels on a form or report display descriptive text such as titles, captions, or brief instructions.

## Remarks

Labels have certain characteristics:


- Labels don't display values from fields or expressions.
    
- Labels are always unbound.
    
- Labels don't change as you move from record to record.

A label can be attached to another control. When you create a text box, for example, it has an attached label that displays a caption for that text box. This label appears as a column heading in the Datasheet view of a form.

When you create a label by using the  **Label** tool, the label stands on its own â€” it isn't attached to any other control. You use stand-alone labels for information such as the title of a form or report, or for other descriptive text. Stand-alone labels don't appear in Datasheet view.
