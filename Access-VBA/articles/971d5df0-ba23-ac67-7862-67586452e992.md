 [Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  ** [Worksheet](182b705e-854a-81cc-a4b0-59b942de55ae.md)** object that represents the next sheet.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Next**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Worksheet** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the object is a range, this property emulates the TAB key, although the property returns the next cell without selecting it.

On a protected sheet, this property returns the next unlocked cell. On an unprotected sheet, this property always returns the cell immediately to the right of the specified cell.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example selects the next unlocked cell on Sheet1. If Sheet1 is unprotected, this is the cell immediately to the right of the active cell.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
ActiveCell.Next.Select 

```
