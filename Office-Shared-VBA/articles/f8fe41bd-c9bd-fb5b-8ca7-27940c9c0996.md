# ODSOColumn Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a field in a data source. The  **ODSOColumn** object is a member of the **ODSOColumns** collection.

## Remarks

The  **ODSOColumns** collection includes all the data fields in a mail merge data source (for example, Name, Address, and City).

You cannot add fields to the  **ODSOColumns** collection. All data fields in a data source are automatically included in the **ODSOColumns** collection.

Use  [Columns](02a3eb37-df7a-923a-6a98-dbb980b413f7.md)( _index_), where  _index_ is the data field name or index number, to return a single **ODSOColumn** object. The index number represents the position of the data field in the mail merge data source.


## Example

This example retrieves the name and value of the first field of the first record in the data source attached to the active publication.


```
Sub GetDataFromSource() 
 
 Dim appOffice As OfficeDataSourceObject 
 
 Set appOffice = Application.OfficeDataSourceObject 
 appOffice.Open bstrConnect:="DRIVER=SQL Server;SERVER=ServerName;" &amp; _ 
 "UID=user;PWD=;DATABASE=Northwind", bstrTable:="Employees" 
 
 With appOffice.Columns 
 MsgBox "Field Name: " &amp; .Item(1).Name &amp; vbLf &amp; _ 
 "Value: " &amp; .Item(1).Value 
 End With 
End Sub
```
