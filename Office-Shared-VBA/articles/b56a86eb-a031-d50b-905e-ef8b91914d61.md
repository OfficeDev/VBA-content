# SmartDocument Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

The  **SmartDocument** property of the **Document** object in Microsoft Word and the **Workbook** object in Microsoft Excel returns a **SmartDocument** object.

## Remarks

Use the  **SmartDocument** object to manage the XML expansion pack attached to the active document.

Use the  **SmartDocument** object's **SolutionID** and **SolutionURI** properties to retrieve information about the XML expansion pack attached to the active document or workbook. Use the **PickSolution** method to allow the user to select an available XML expansion pack from a list to attach to the active document or workbook. Use the **RefreshPane** method to refresh the smart document's **Document Actions** task pane.

The  **SmartDocument** object model is available whether or not a document has an XML expansion pack attached. The **SmartDocument** property of the **Document** or **Workbook**objects does not return **Nothing** when the active document has no XML expansion pack attached. Examine the **SolutionID** property to determine whether the active document has an XML expansion pack attached.
