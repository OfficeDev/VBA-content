# SharedWorkspaceMember Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a user who has rights in a shared document workspace site.

 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Remarks

Use the  **SharedWorkspaceMember** object to manage users who have rights to participate in a shared workspace and to collaborate on the shared documents saved in the workspace site.

 The **Role** specified when the user is added as a member of the workspace (for example, "Reader" or "Contributor") determines that user's rights in the workspace and cannot be accessed or modified later through properties of the **SharedWorkspaceMember** object.

Use the  **Item**( _index_) property of the  **SharedWorkspaceMembers** collection to return a specific **SharedWorkspaceMember** object.

Use the  **SharedWorkspaceMember** object's three distinct name properties to retrieve identifying information about the member.


- the  **Name** property returns the members display name;
    
- the  **Email** property returns the member's e-mail address; and,
    
- the  **DomainName** property returns the member's domain and user name in the format `domain\user`.
    



## Example

The following example displays the number of members in the active document's shared workspace, along with their names, domain user names, and e-mail addresses.


```
    Dim swsMember As Office.SharedWorkspaceMember 
    Dim strMemberInfo As String 
    strMemberInfo = "The shared workspace contains " &amp; _ 
        ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Members.Count &amp; " member(s)." &amp; vbCrLf 
    If ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Members.Count > 0 Then 
        For Each swsMember In ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Members 
            strMemberInfo = strMemberInfo &amp; swsMember.Name &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
                " - " &amp; swsMember.DomainName &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
                " - " &amp; swsMember.Email &amp; vbCrLf 
        Next 
    End If 
    MsgBox strMemberInfo, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, _ 
        "Members in Shared Workspace" 
    Set swsMember = Nothing 

```
