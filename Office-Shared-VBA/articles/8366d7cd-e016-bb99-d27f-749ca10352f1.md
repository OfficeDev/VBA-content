# DocumentInspectors Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a collection of  **DocumentInspector** objects.

## Remarks

The  **DocumentInspectors** collection is part of the **Document** object in Microsoft Word, the **Workbook** object in Microsoft Excel, and the **Presentation** object in MicrosoftPowerPoint. A **DocumentInspectors** collection contains multiple **DocumentInspector** objects, one for some built-in options and each installed custom Document Inspector module. For more information, see the **DocumentInspector** help topic.


## Example

The following example calls the  **Fix** method of a Document Inspector module and displays the status of the action and the specific items that are removed.


```
Public Sub FixDocument() 
Dim docStatus As MsoDocInspectorStatus 
Dim results As String 
 ActiveDocument.DocumentInspectors(3).Fix docStatus, results 
 
 MsgBox docStatus 
 MsgBox("The following items were removed " &amp; results) 
 
End Sub 

```
