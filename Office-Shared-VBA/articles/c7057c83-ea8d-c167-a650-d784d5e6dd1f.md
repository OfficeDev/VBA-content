 _expression_. **Visible**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CommandBar** object.


### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The  **Visible** property for newly created custom command bars is **False** by default.

The  **Enabled** property for a command bar must be set to **True** before the **Visible** property is set to **True**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

This example steps through the collection of command bars to find the  **Forms** command bar. If the **Forms** command bar is found, the example makes it visible and protects its docking state.


```
foundFlag = False  
For Each cmdbar In CommandBars 
    If cmdbar.Name = "Forms" Then 
        cmdbar.Protection = msoBarNoChangeDock 
        cmdbar.Visible = True  
        foundFlag = True  
    End If 
Next 
If Not foundFlag Then 
    MsgBox "'Forms'command bar is not in the collection." 
End If
```
