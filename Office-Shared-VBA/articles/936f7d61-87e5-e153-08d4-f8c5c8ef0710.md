# LanguageSettings Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Returns information about the language settings in a Microsoft Office application.

## Remarks

Use Application.LanguageSettings.LanguageID( _MsoAppLanguageID_), where  [MsoAppLanguageID](78196ded-10d3-2088-f263-44a771ee78b4.md) is a constant used to return locale identifier (LCID) information to the specified application.


## Example

The following example returns the install language, user interface language, and Help language LCIDs in a message box.


```
MsgBox "The following locale IDs are registered " &amp; _ 
 "for this application: Install Language - " &amp; _ 
 Application.LanguageSettings.LanguageID(msoLanguageIDInstall) &amp; _ 
 " User Interface Language - " &amp; _ 
 Application.LanguageSettings.LanguageID(msoLanguageIDUI) &amp; _ 
 " Help Language - " &amp; _ 
 Application.LanguageSettings.LanguageID(msoLanguageIDHelp)
```

Use  **Application.LanguageSettings.LanguagePreferredForEditing** to determine which LCIDs are registered as preferred editing languages for the application, as in the following example.




```
If Application.LanguageSettings. _ 
 LanguagePreferredForEditing(msoLanguageIDEnglishUS) Then 
 MsgBox "U.S. English is one of the chosen editing languagess." 
End If
```
