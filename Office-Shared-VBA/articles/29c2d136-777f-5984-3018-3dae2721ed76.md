```
Sub PictureEffectSample() 
' Setup a slide with one picture shape. 
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1).Fill.PictureEffects 
 
 ' Insert a 150% Saturation effect. 
 .Insert(msoEffectSaturation).EffectParameters(1).Value = 1.5 
 
 ' Insert Brightness/Contrast effect and set values to -50% Brightness and +25% Contrast. 
 Dim brightnessContrast As PictureEffect 
 Set brightnessContrast = .Insert(msoEffectBrightnessContrast) 
 brightnessContrast.EffectParameters(1).Value = -0.5 
 brightnessContrast.EffectParameters(2).Value = 0.25 
 
 ' Remove all Picture effects. 
 While .Count > 0 
 .Delete (1) 
 Wend 
 
End With 
End Sub
