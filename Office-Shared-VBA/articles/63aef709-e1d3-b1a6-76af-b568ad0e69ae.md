# IRibbonControl Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the object passed into the callback procedure of a control in a ribbon or another user interface that can be customized by using Office Fluent ribbon extensibility.

## Remarks

The  **IRibbonControl** object contains the name (ID) of the control and the current **Window** object for the Ribbon UI control.


## Example

The following example, written in C#, shows two procedures called from the  **onAction** event procedure of a Button control and a ToggleButton control. In the first procedure, the **IRibbonControl** object representing the control is passed into the procedure and a message box is displayed indicating that the button was pressed along with the ID of the button. The second procedure is similar to the first with the addition of a **Boolean** parameter indicating that the button was pressed.


```
public void ButtonOnAction(IRibbonControl control) 
{ 
 MessageBox.Show("Button clicked: " + control.Id); 
} 
 
public void ToggleButtonOnAction(IRibbonControl control, bool pressed) 
{ 
...if (pressed) 
 MessageBox.Show("ToggleButton was switched on."); 
 else 
 MessageBox.Show("ToggleButton was switched off."); 
}
```
