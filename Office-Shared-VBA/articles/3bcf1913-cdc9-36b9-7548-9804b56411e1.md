 _expression_. **Modified**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **DocumentLibraryVersion** object.


## Remarks

The  **Modified** property of the active document version represents the last time the user saved changes to the open document.

The following example displays the Modified date and time along with other properties of each version of a shared document.


```
 Dim dlvVersions As Office.DocumentLibraryVersions 
 Dim dlvVersion As Office.DocumentLibraryVersion 
 Dim strVersionInfo As String 
 Set dlvVersions = ActiveDocument.DocumentLibraryVersions 
 If dlvVersions.IsVersioningEnabled Then 
 strVersionInfo = "This document has " &amp; _ 
 dlvVersions.Count &amp; " versions: " &amp; vbCrLf 
 For Each dlvVersion In dlvVersions 
 strVersionInfo = strVersionInfo &amp; _ 
 " - Version #: " &amp; dlvVersion.Index &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " - Modified by: " &amp; dlvVersion.ModifiedBy &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " - Modified on: " &amp; dlvVersion.Modified &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " - Comments: " &amp; dlvVersion.Comments &amp; vbCrLf
