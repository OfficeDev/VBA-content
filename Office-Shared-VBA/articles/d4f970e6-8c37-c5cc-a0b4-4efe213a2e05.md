## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following example creates a command bar button on the  **File** menu of the host application that enables the user to save a workbook as a comma-separated value file. (This example works in all applications, but the context of saving as CSV is applicable to Microsoft Excel.)


```
Private HostApp As Object 
 
Sub createAndSynch() 
    Dim iIndex As Integer 
    Dim iCount As Integer 
    Dim fBtnExists As Boolean 
     
    Dim obCmdBtn As Object 
    Dim btnSaveAsCSVHandler as new Class1 
          
    Set HostApp = Application 
     
    Dim barHelp As Office.CommandBar 
    Set barHelp = Application.CommandBars("File") 
    fBtnExists = False  
    iCount = barHelp.Controls.Count 
    For iIndex = 1 To iCount 
        If barHelp.Controls(iIndex).Caption = "Save As CSV (Comma Delimited)" Then fBtnExists = True  
     
    Next 
    Dim btnSaveAsCSV As Office.CommandBarButton 
    If fBtnExists Then 
        Set btnSaveAsCSV = barHelp.Controls("Save As CSV (Comma Delimited)") 
    Else 
        Set btnSaveAsCSV = barHelp.Controls.Add(msoControlButton) 
        btnSaveAsCSV.Caption = "Save As CSV (Comma Delimited)" 
    End If 
     
    btnSaveAsCSV.Tag = "btn1" 
    btnSaveAsCSVHandler.SyncButton btnSaveAsCSV 
End Sub
```
