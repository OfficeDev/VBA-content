# TextFrame2 Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents the text frame in a  **Shape** or **ShapeRange** object. Contains the text in the text frame and exposes properties and methods that control the alignment and anchoring of the text frame.

## Remarks

Use the TextFrame2 property of the Shape and ShapeRange objects to return a TextFrame2 object. 


## Example

The following code adds a rectangle to a slide, adds text to the rectangle, and then sets the margins for the text frame.


```
Set pptSlide = ActivePresentation.Slides(1) 
With pptSlide.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 0, 0, 250, 140).TextFrame2 
 .TextRange.Text = "Here is some sample text" 
 .MarginBottom = 10 
 .MarginLeft = 10 
 .MarginRight = 10 
 .MarginTop = 10 
End With 

```
