 **MsoDocInspectorStatus** members

There are two Document Inspector modules that are included with Microsoft Office. These are the  **Comments/Revisions** module and the **Document Properties** method. These are the first two options that show up in the **Document Inspector** dialog box but are not available in the **DocumentInspectors** collection.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example demonstrates implementing the  **Fix** method of the **DocumentInspector** object. You specify which Document Inspector module to execute with the index value specified in the **DocumentInspectors** collection. Before executing this method, you would likely run the **Inspect** method to determine if there are any hidden worksheets in the workbook.


```
Public Sub DI_FixDocument() 
Dim docStatus As MsoDocInspectorStatus 
Dim result As String 
ActiveDocument.DocumentInspectors(3).Fix docStatus, result 
 
MsgBox ("The Fix method returned the following status " &amp; docStatus &amp; _ 
" with this result " &amp; result) 
End Sub
```
