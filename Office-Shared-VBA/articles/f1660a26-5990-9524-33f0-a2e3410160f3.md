 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains first-line indent and hanging indent information for an outline level.

## Remarks

The  **RulerLevel2** object is a member of the **RulerLevels2** collection. The **RulerLevels2** collection contains a **RulerLevel2** object for each of the five available outline levels.


## Example

Use  `RulerLevels2(index)`, where index is the outline level, to return a single  **RulerLevel2** object. The following example sets the first-line indent and hanging indent for outline level one in body text on the slide master for the active presentation.


```
With ActivePresentation.SlideMaster _ 
 .TextStyles(ppBodyStyle).Ruler2.Levels(1) 
 .FirstMargin = 9 
 .LeftMargin = 54 
End With 

```
