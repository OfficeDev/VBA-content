# SharedWorkspaceFolder Object (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a folder in a shared document workspace.

 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Remarks

Use the  **SharedWorkspaceFolder** object to manage subfolders within the main document library folder of a shared workspace.

 The **Count** property of the ** SharedWorkspaceFolders** collection does not include the workspace's main folder and returns 0 (zero) if no subfolders have been created.

The  **SharedWorkspaceFolder** object does not expose the **CreatedBy**,  **CreatedDate** , **ModifiedBy**, and  **ModifiedDate** properties available on the **SharedWorkspaceFile**,  **SharedWorkspaceLink**, and  **SharedWorkspaceTask** objects.

Use the  **Item**( _index_) property of the  **SharedWorkspaceFolders** collection to return a specific **SharedWorkspaceFolder** object.


## Example

Use the  **FolderName** property to return the name of the shared workspace folder. The following example returns the name of the first subfolder in the **SharedWorkspaceFolders** collection in the format "parentfoldername/foldername."


```
    Dim swsFolder As SharedWorkspaceFolder 
    Set swsFolder = ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Folders(1) 
    MsgBox swsFolder.FolderName, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "Folder Name" 
    Set swsFolder = Nothing 

```
