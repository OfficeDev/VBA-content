# Permission.Enabled Property (Office)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Gets or sets a  **Boolean** value that indicates whether permissions are enabled on the active document. Read/write.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **Enabled**

 _expression_Required. A variable that represents a  ** [Permission](4bdf7058-d4ba-0bd4-c5cd-141d67245ced.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use the  **Enabled** property to determine whether permissions are restricted on the active document, and to enable or disable permissions. Set Enabled to **False** to disable permissions and to remove all users, other than the document author, and their permissions.

When permissions are disabled, the  **Count** property of the **Permission** object returns 0 (zero); however, when permissions are re-enabled, the permissions of the document author remain intact.
