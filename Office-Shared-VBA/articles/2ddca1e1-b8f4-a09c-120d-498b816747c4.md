Set myBar = CommandBars _ 
    .Add(Name:="Custom", Position:=msoBarTop, _ 
    Temporary:=True) 
With myBar 
    .Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton 
    .Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton 
    .Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton 
    .Visible = True  
End With 
Set myControl = CommandBars("Custom").Controls(2) 
With myControl 
    .SetFocus 
End With 
PauseTime = 5   ' Set duration. 
    Start = Timer   ' Set start time. 
    Do While Timer  Start + PauseTime
