# View.ShowCropMarks Property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that represents whether to show crop marks in the corners of pages to indicate where margins are located. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ShowCropMarks**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **View** object.


## Remarks

Displaying crop marks does not allow a user to change the margins by dragging the crop marks. Crop marks are only displayed to indicate where margins are located in the page. This property corresponds to the  **Crop marks** check box in the **Advanced** tab of the **Word Options** dialog box.


 **Note**  Crop marks are shown by default in East Asian languages and are off by default in all other langauges.
