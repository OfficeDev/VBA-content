```vb
Sub FeaturesDisableByDefault() 
 With Application.Options 
 
 'Checks whether features are disabled 
 If .DisableFeaturesbyDefault = True Then 
 
 'If they are, disables all features after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterbyDefault = wd70 
 Else 
 
 'If not, turns on the disable features option and disables 
 'all features introduced after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeaturesbyDefault = True 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterbyDefault = wd70 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
