# Shape.ConvertToInlineShape Method (Word)

Converts the specified shape in the drawing layer of a document to an inline shape in the text layer. You can convert only shapes that represent pictures, OLE objects, or ActiveX controls. This method returns an  **[InlineShape](a8fd110a-4aa7-c4b9-1559-32022787d955.md)** object that represents the picture or OLE object.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ConvertToInlineShape**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)** object.


## Remarks

Shapes that support attached text cannot be converted to inline shapes. For these shapes, use the  **ConvertToFrame** method.



If you use this method on a  **ShapeRange** object that contains more than one shape, an error occurs.




## Example

This example converts each picture in MyDoc.doc to an inline shape.


```vb

 If s.Type = msoPicture Then 
 s.ConvertToInlineShape 
 End If 
Next s
```
