# Document.Path Property (Word)

Returns the disk or Web path to the document. Read-only  **String** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Path**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

The path doesn't include a trailing character — for example, "C:\MSOffice" or "http://MyServer". Use the  **PathSeparator** property to add the character that separates folders and drive letters. Use the **Name** property to return the file name without the path and use the **FullName** property to return the file name and the path together.


 **Note**  You can use the  **PathSeparator** property to build Web addresses even though they contain forward slashes (/) and the **PathSeparator** property defaults to a backslash (\).


## Example

This example displays the path and file name of the active document.


```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Path &; Application.PathSeparator &; _ 
 ActiveDocument.Name
```

This example changes the current folder to the path of the template attached to the active document.




```
ChDir ActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate.Path
```
