# Creating a Custom Dialog Box

Use the following procedure to create a custom dialog box:


1.  [Create a UserForm](creating-a-userform.md)
    
    On the  **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, click **UserForm**.
    
2.  [Add controls to the UserForm](adding-controls-to-a-userform.md)
    
    Find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox** and drag the control onto the form.
    
3.  [Set control properties](setting-control-properties-word.md)
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click  **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
4.  [Initialize the controls](initializing-control-properties-word.md)
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure before you show a form, or you can add code to the  **Initialize** event of the form.
    
5.  [Write event procedures](control-and-dialog-box-events-word.md)
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a  **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
    
6.  [Show the dialog box](displaying-a-custom-dialog-box-word.md)
    
    Use the  **Show**method to display a UserForm.
    
7.  [Use control values while code is running](using-control-values-while-code-is-running-word.md)
    
    Some properties can be set at run time. Values the user sets for controls in the dialog box are lost when the dialog box is closed.
