## Example

This example displays a message before the mail merge process begins, asking the user if they want to continue. If the user clicks No, the merge process is canceled. This example assumes that you have declared an application variable called MailMergeApp in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Microsoft Word Application object.


```vb
Private Sub MailMergeApp_MailMergeBeforeMerge(ByVal Doc As Document, _ 
 ByVal StartRecord As Long, ByVal EndRecord As Long, _ 
 Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Dim intVBAnswer As Integer 
 
 'Request whether the user wants to continue with the merge 
 intVBAnswer = MsgBox("Mail Merge for " &; _ 
 Doc.Name &; " is now starting. " &; _ 
 "Do you want to continue?", vbYesNo, "MailMergeBeforeMerge Event") 
 
 'If users response to question is No, cancel the merge process 
 'and deliver a message to the user stating the merge is canceled 
 If intVBAnswer = vbNo Then 
 Cancel = True 
 MsgBox "You have canceled mail merge for " &; _ 
 Doc.Name &; "." 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
