# ScopeFolders Object (Office)

A collection of  **ScopeFolder** objects.


## Remarks

Only  **ScopeFolder** objects contain **ScopeFolders** collections. Each **ScopeFolders** collection contains the **ScopeFolder** objects that correspond to the subfolders of the parent **ScopeFolder** object.

Use the  **ScopeFolders** property of the **ScopeFolder** object to return a **ScopeFolders** collection.

You can't add or remove  **ScopeFolder** objects from a **ScopeFolders** collection.
