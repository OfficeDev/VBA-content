# Office VBA Reference

Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an event-driven programming language that enables you to extend Office applications. 



## VBA Programming in Office

This reference is for experienced Office users who want to learn about VBA and who want some insight into how programming can help them to customize Office.

The Office suite of applications has a full set of features. There are many different ways to author, format, and manipulate documents, email, databases, forms, spreadsheets, and presentations. 

The great power of VBA programming in Office is that nearly every operation that you can perform with a mouse, keyboard, or a dialog box can also be automated by using VBA. Further, if it can be done once with VBA, it can be done just as easily a hundred times. In fact, the automation of repetitive tasks is one of the most common uses of VBA in Office.

Beyond the power of scripting VBA to accelerate every-day tasks, you can use VBA to add new functionality to Office applications or to prompt and interact with the user of your documents in ways that are specific to your business needs. For example, you could write some VBA code that displays a pop up message that reminds users to save a document to a particular network drive the first time they try to save it.
