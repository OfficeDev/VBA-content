# Series.XValues Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets an array of x values for a chart series. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **XValues**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Series](5c8c2d92-d8ca-4d21-e213-c374292275d4.md)** object.


## Remarks

You can set the  **XValues** property to a range on a worksheet or to an array of values, but not to a combination of both.

For PivotChart reports, this property is read-only.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example sets the values from a range address.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).XValues = "=Sheet1!B1:B5"

    End If

End With
```




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

To assign a constant value to each individual data point, you must use an array, as shown in the following example.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)
    If .HasChart Then
        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).XValues = _
            Array(5.0, 6.3, 12.6, 28, 50)
    End If
End With
```
