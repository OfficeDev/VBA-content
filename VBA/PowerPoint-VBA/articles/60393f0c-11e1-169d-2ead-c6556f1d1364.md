Sub CheckOutPresentation(strPresentation As String)
    If Presentations.CanCheckOut(strPresentation) = True Then
        Presentations.CheckOut FileName:=strPresentation
    Else
        MsgBox "You are unable to check out this " &; _
        "presentation at this time."
    End If
End Sub
```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the " _http://servername/workspace/report.ppt_ " file name with an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```vb
Sub CheckPPTOut()
    Call CheckOutPresentation(strPresentation:= _
        "http://servername/workspace/report.doc ")
End Sub
```
