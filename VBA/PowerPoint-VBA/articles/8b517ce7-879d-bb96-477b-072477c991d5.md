Private Sub PPTApp_ColorSchemeChanged(ByVal SldRange As SlideRange)



    If SldRange.Count = 1 Then

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _
            &; SldRange.Name &; "."

    Else

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _
            &; SldRange.Count &; " slides."
