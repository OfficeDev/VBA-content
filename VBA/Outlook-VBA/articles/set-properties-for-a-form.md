# Set Properties for a Form

## Forms customized with form regions

To set properties for a form region in a custom form, you must use the XML manifest file instead of the Forms Designer. To learn more, see  [How to: Create a Form Region](create-a-form-region.md).


## Forms customized with form pages


1. In the Forms Designer, click the  **(Properties)** tab.
    
2. To be able to send a copy of the form in e-mail, select the  **Send form definition with item** check box.
    
3. To have the form show only for replies to messages, select the  **Use form only for responses** check box.
    
4. Select other options that you want.
