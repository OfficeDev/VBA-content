# Publish a Form

 **Note**  You cannot publish forms that you customized with form regions to the server; instead, you must deploy them by using an add-in. For more information, see  [How to: Extend a Form Region with an Add-in](extending-a-form-region-with-an-add-in.md).


## Publish a form customized with form pages


1. In Microsoft Outlook, on the  **Developer** tab, in the **Custom Forms** group, click **Choose Form**. 
    
2. In the  **Choose Form** dialog box, select a customized form from the forms library and click **Open**. 
    
3. On the  **Developer** tab, in the **Form** group, click **Publish**, and then click  **Publish Form**. 
    

 **Note**  Publishing a form that has not been previously published will open the  **Publish Form As** dialog box.
