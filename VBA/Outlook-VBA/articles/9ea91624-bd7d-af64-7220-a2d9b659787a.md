# AddressList.GetContactsFolder Method (Outlook)

Obtains a  **[Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object that represents the Contacts folder for the **[AddressList](84611afe-48b1-185b-df4b-0f004e7436ff.md)** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **GetContactsFolder**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **AddressList** object.


### Return Value

A  **Folder** object that represents the Outlook Contacts folder for the **AddressList** . Returns **Null** ( **Nothing** in Visual Basic) if no Outlook contacts folder is found.


## Remarks

This method allows you to match an  **AddressList** for the Contacts folder that you would like to set up as the initial address list in the **Select Names** dialog box.


## Example

The following code sample shows you how to initialize the  **Select Names** dialog box with the **AddressList** for the default Contacts folder. It first obtains the **Folder** object for the default Contacts folder, and looks for its **AddressList** by comparing the Entry ID of this **Folder** object with the Entry ID of the **Folder** object assoicated with each **AddressList** in the current session until it finds a match. It then sets the **[InitialAddressList](19cfe6be-e6b5-62e0-741a-b196ef7bac77.md)** property and displays the **Select Names** dialog box.


```vb
Sub SetContactsFolderAsInitialAddressList() 
 
 Dim oMsg As MailItem 
 
 Set oMsg = Application.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 
 Dim oDialog As SelectNamesDialog 
 
 Set oDialog = Application.Session.GetSelectNamesDialog 
 
 Dim oAL As AddressList 
 
 Dim oContacts As Folder 
 
 Set oContacts = _ 
 
 Application.Session.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderContacts) 
 
 
 
 On Error GoTo HandleError 
 
 'Look for the AddressList for the default Contacts folder 
 
 For Each oAL In Application.Session.AddressLists 
 
 If oAL.AddressListType = olOutlookAddressList Then 
 
 If oAL.GetContactsFolder.EntryID = _ 
 
 oContacts.EntryID Then 
 
 Exit For 
 
 End If 
 
 End If 
 
 Next 
 
 
 
 With oDialog 
 
 .Caption = "Select Customer Contact" 
 
 .ToLabel = "Customer C&;ontact" 
 
 .NumberOfRecipientSelectors = olShowTo 
 
 .InitialAddressList = oAL 
 
 
 
 'Let the selected names be the recipients of the new message 
 
 .Recipients = oMsg.Recipients 
 
 
 
 If .Display Then 
 
 'Recipients Resolved 
 
 End If 
 
 End With 
 
 
 
HandleError: 
 
 Exit Sub 
 
End Sub
```
