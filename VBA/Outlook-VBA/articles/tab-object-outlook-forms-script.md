# Tab Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Represents an individual member of a  **[Tabs](tabs-object-outlook-forms-script.md)** collection.


## Remarks

Visually, a  **Tab** object appears as a rectangle protruding from a larger rectangular area, or as a button adjacent to a rectangular area.

In contrast to a  **[Page](page-object-outlook-forms-script.md)**, a  **Tab** does not contain any controls. Controls that appear within the region bounded by a **[TabStrip](tabstrip-object-outlook-forms-script.md)** are contained on the form, as is the **TabStrip**.

You can reference a  **Tab** by its index value. The index value reflects the ordinal position of the **Tab** within the collection. The index of the first **Tab** in a collection is 0; the index of the second **Tab** is 1; and so on.
