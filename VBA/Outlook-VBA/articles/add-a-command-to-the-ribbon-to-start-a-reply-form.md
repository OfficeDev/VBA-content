# Add a Command to the Ribbon to Start a Reply Form

Use this procedure to customize a Microsoft Outlook form page. To customize a form region, see  [How to: Create a Custom Action for a Form Region](create-a-custom-action-for-a-form-region.md).


1. In the Forms Designer, click the  **(Actions)** page of your form.
    
2. Click an action that you created, and then click  **Properties**. 
    
3. Select the  **Show action on** check box.Outlook uses the text in the **Action name** box as the command name or the button name on the form.After you complete the procedure, the new command is available for **Custom Actions** on the ribbon.
    
     **Note**  The  **Menu and Toolbar** and **Menu only** options apply only to forms displayed in versions of Outlook earlier than Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.
