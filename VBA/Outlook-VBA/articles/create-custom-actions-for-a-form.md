# Create Custom Actions for a Form

Actions are a very powerful feature of forms in Microsoft Outlook that you can use to create a wide variety of solutions without writing code. For example, you can use actions to open other forms, even forms of a different type, or you can create a message form with an action that opens a contact form.


## Forms customized with form regions

You can specify custom actions for a form region. To create an action that suits your needs, you can either modify a built-in action or create a new custom action. For more information, see  [How to: Create a Custom Action for a Form Region](create-a-custom-action-for-a-form-region.md).


## Forms customized with form pages

In the Forms Designer, do the following:


1. Click the  **(Actions)** page.
    
2. Click  **New**. 
    
3. Select the options that you want.
    

 **Note**
