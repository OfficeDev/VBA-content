# Set Properties for Controls

There are two types of properties for a control: Outlook properties and advanced properties. Outlook properties are the basic properties needed to design a control. Advanced properties offer additional functionality.

Outlook properties are set in the  **Properties** dialog box and must be set individually. Advanced properties are set in the **Advanced Properties** dialog box and can be set for multiple controls at once.

## To set properties for a control


1. Right-click the control, then click  **Properties**. 
    
2. Select the options that you want.
    

## To set advanced properties for controls


1. Select the control(s) that you want to modify, right-click one of the controls, and then click  **Advanced Properties**. 
    
2. Select the options that you want.
