# View.Reset Method (Outlook)

Resets a built-in Microsoft Outlook view to its original settings.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Reset**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **View** object.


## Remarks

This method works only on built-in Outlook views.

To properly reset the current view, you must do a  **View.Reset** and then a **[View.Apply](b121d1ce-24b7-4ace-8369-42e5c7becd0a.md)** . The code sample below illustrates the order of the calls:




```vb
Sub ResetView() 
 
 Dim v as Outlook.View 
 
 ' Save a reference to the current view object 
 
 Set v = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentView 
 
 ' Reset and then apply the current view 
 
 v.Reset 
 
 v.Apply 
 
End Sub
```


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example resets all built-in views in the user's  **Inbox** to their original settings. The **[Standard](99fc4067-29e6-8597-09e7-057d2533b022.md)** property is returned to determine if the view is a built-in Outlook view.


```vb
Sub ResetViews() 
 
 'Resets all standard views in the user's Inbox 
 
 
 
 Dim objName As Outlook.NameSpace 
 
 Dim objViews As Outlook.Views 
 
 Dim objView As Outlook.View 
 
 
 
 Set objName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set objViews = objName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox).Views 
 
 For Each objView In objViews 
 
 If objView.Standard = True Then 
 
 objView.Reset 
 
 End If 
 
 Next objView 
 
End Sub
```
