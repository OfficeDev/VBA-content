# Using the Field Chooser

Although you can add a control to a form and then bind the control to a field, it is usually more effective to use the  **Field Chooser**. When you bind a control, you establish a link between the control and the source of data, which in this case is a field in the item. You can use the  **Field Chooser** to add a control and bind it to a field in a single step. Also, in many cases, the built-in control that the **Field Chooser** provides has special features and capabilities that cannot be duplicated by binding a field to a standard control.

Microsoft Outlook displays the  **Field Chooser** whenever you open a form in design mode. For more information, see [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](run-in-developer-mode-in-outlook.md).
