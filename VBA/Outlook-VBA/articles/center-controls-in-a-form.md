# Center Controls in a Form

1. Select the controls or groups of controls that you want to center. (The dominant control does not affect this procedure. For more information, see  [How to: Select Multiple Controls and the Dominant Control](select-multiple-controls-and-the-dominant-control.md)).
    
2. On the  **Developer** tab, in the **Arrange** group, click **Align**, point to  **Center in Form**, and then click  **Horizontally** or **Vertically**.
