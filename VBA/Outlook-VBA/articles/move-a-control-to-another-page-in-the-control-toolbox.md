# Move a Control to Another Page in the Control Toolbox

1. If the  **Control Toolbox** is not visible, on the **Developer** tab, in the **Tools** group, click **Control Toolbox**. 
    
2. Drag a control on any page to the label of another page. Hold the mouse pointer over the label until the page appears on top, and then drag the control onto the page.
    

 **Note**  If the page to which you want to move a control is not visible, increase the width of the  **Control Toolbox** to show all the pages, and then drag the control to the appropriate page.
