# Show or Hide the Grid

When you design a form, use the grid to align controls easily and precisely.


- In the Forms Designer, on the  **Developer** tab, in the **Arrange** group, click **Align**, and then click  **Show Grid**.
    

 **Note**  When you customize forms with form regions, the grid is not displayed by default.

For more information, see  [How to: Set the Grid Size](set-the-grid-size.md).
