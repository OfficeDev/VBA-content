# Control Groups Overview

A group is a collection of two or more controls on a form that you can work with as a single unit. You can include any control on the form in a group. After controls belong to a group, you can work with the entire group, or you can select a single control.

There are many ways to work with groups and the controls in groups. After you select a group, you can do any of the following:

- Size all controls in the group at the same time. 
    
- Separate controls in the group so that each is independent of the others.
    
- Show the group shortcut menu for quick access to commands that affect the group. 
    
- Select a single control within the group without separating other controls in the group. You can then change the property settings of the selected control without affecting other controls in the group.
