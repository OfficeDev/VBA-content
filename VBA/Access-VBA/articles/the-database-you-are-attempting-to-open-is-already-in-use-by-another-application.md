# The database you are attempting to open is already in use by another application. (Error 3576)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

If you are attempting to open the database in exclusive mode, it is possible that another application already has the database open. If you are attempting to open the database in shared mode, it is possible that another application has the database open in exclusive mode. Close the other applications using the database and try your request again.
