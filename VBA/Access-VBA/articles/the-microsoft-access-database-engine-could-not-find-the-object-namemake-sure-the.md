# The Microsoft Access database engine could not find the object <name>. Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly. (Error 3011)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Possible causes:



- The specified object does not exist.
    
- You misspelled the object name. Check for missing underscores ( _ ) or other punctuation, and make sure you did not enter leading spaces.
    
- If you are trying to open a Btrieve table, the paths indicated in the data definition file File.ddf may be incorrect. Be sure your data (.dat) files are in the correct directories.
