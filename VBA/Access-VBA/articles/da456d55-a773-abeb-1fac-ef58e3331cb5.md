The  **Before Change** event occurs when a record changes, but before the change is committed.

 **Note**  The  **Before Change** event is available only in Data Macros.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

Use the  **Before Change** event to perform any actions that you want to occur before a record is changed. The **Before Change** is commonly used to perform validation and to raise custom error messages.

You can use the  **Updated(" _Field Name_ ")** function to determine whether a field has changed. The following code example shows how to use an **If** statement to determine whether the **PaidInFull** field has been changed.




```text
If Updated("PaidInFull") Then  
    /* Perform actions based on changes to the field.   */ 
End If 
```

Use the  **IsInsert** property to determine whether the **Before Change** event was triggered by a new record being created or a change to an existing record. They **IsInsert** property contains **True** if the event was triggered by a new record, **False** if the event was triggered by a change to en existing record.

The following code example shows the syntax for using the  **IsInsert** property.




```text
If [IsInsert] = True   Then 
 
   /*  Actions for validating a new record go here.       */ 
 
Else 
 
   /* Actions for processing a changed record go here.    */ 
 
End If
```

You can use access a the previous value in a field by using the following syntax.




```sql
[Old].[Field Name]
```

For example, to access the previous value of the  **QuantityInStock** field, use the following syntax.




```sql
[Old].[QuantityInStock]
```

The previous values are deleted permanently when the  **Before Change** event ends.

You can cancel the  **Before Change** event by using the **RaiseError** action. When an error is raised the changes contained in the **Before Change** event are discarded.

The following table lists macro commands that can be used in the **Before Change** event.

To create a Data Macro that captures the  **Before Change** event, use the following steps:


1. Open the table for which you want to capture the  **Before Change** event.
    
2. On the  **Table** tab, in the **Before Events** group, click **Before Change**.
    
An empty data macro is displayed in the macro designer.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The following code example uses the  **Before Change** event to validate the Status fields. An error is raised if an inappropriate value is contained in the **Resolution** field.

 **Click here to view a copy of the macro that you can paste into Macro Designer.**






```text
/* Check to ensure that if the bug is resloved that the user has selected a resolution      */ 
If   [Status]="3 - Resolved" And IsNull([Resolution])   Then 
 
     RaiseError 
             Error Number   1 
        Error Description   You must select a resolution. 
End If 
 
/* Check to ensure that if a bug is closed that the user has selected a resolution first     */ 
If   [Status]="4 - Closed" And IsNull([Resolution])   Then 
 
      RaiseError 
             Error Number   2 
        Error Description   An issue must be resolved before it can be closed. 
End If 
 
If   [Status]<>"3 - Resolved" And [Status]<>"4 - Closed"   Then 
 
      SetField 
             Name   Resolution 
            Value   =Null 
End If 
```

To view this example in the macro designer, use the following steps.


1. Open the table for which you want to capture the  **Before Change** event.
    
2. On the  **Table** tab, in the **Before Events** group, click **Before Change**.
    
3. Select the code in the following code example and then press  **CTRL+C** to copy it to the Clipboard.
    
4. Activate the macro designer window and then press  **CTRL+V**.

  </DataMacro> 
</DataMacros>
```

The following example shows how to use the  **RaiseError** action to cancel the **Before Change** data macro event. When the **AssignedTo** field is updated, a **LookupRecord** data block is used to determine whether the assigned technician is currently assigned to an open service request. If this is true, then the **Before Change** event is cancelled and the record is not updated.

 **Sample code provided by:** The[Microsoft Access 2010 Programmer's Reference](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Access-2010-Programmer-s-Reference.productCd-0470591668.mdl)




```text
/* Get the name of the technician  */
Look Up A Record In tblTechnicians
    Where Condition =[tblTechnicians].[ID]=[tblServiceRequests].[AssignedTo]
SetLocalVar
    Name TechName
    Expression [tblTechnicians].[FirstName] &; " " &; [tblTechnicians].[LastName]
/* End LookUpRecord  */

If Updated("AssignedTo") Then
    Look Up A Record In tblServiceRequests
        Where Condition SR.[AssignedTo]=tblServiceRequests[AssignedTo] And 
            SR.[ID]<>tblServiceRequests.[ID] And IsNull(SR.[ActualCompletionDate])
        Alias SR
        RaiseError
            Error Number 1234
            Error Description ="Cannot assign a request to the specified technician: " &; [TechName]

End If
```
