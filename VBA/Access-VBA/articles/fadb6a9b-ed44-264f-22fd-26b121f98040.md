The server program uses the connect string and command text to query the data source for the desired rows. ADO is typically used to retrieve this  **Recordset**, although other Microsoft data access interfaces, such as OLE DB, could be used.

A custom server program might look like this:



```vb
 
Public Function ServerProgram(cn as String, qry as String) as Object 
Dim rs as New ADODB.Recordset 
 rs.CursorLocation = adUseClient 
 rs.Open qry, cn 
 rs.ActiveConnection = Nothing 
 Set ServerProgram = rs 
End Function
```
