Indicates whether a particular record was found by using the  **[Seek](ef83d909-c962-b016-7d33-36eacdc25c2c.md)** method or one of the **[Find](5fcf78cd-7d2c-2e47-14e5-996f2e14ff51.md)** methods (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **NoMatch**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When you open or create a  **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object, its **NoMatch** property is set to **False**.

To locate a record, use the  **Seek** method on a table-type **Recordset** object or one of the **Find** methods on a dynaset- or snapshot-type **Recordset** object. Check the **NoMatch** property setting to see whether the record was found.

If the  **Seek** or **Find** method is unsuccessful and the **NoMatch** property is **True**, the current record will no longer be valid. Be sure to obtain the current record's bookmark before using the **Seek** method or a **Find** method if you'll need to return to that record.




 **Note**  Using any of the  **[Move](338f7e86-6997-b80a-fc7a-a395d10b4a62.md)** methods on a **Recordset** object won't affect its **NoMatch** property setting.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **NoMatch** property to determine whether a **Seek** and a **FindFirst** were successful, and if not, to give appropriate feedback. The **SeekMatch** and **FindMatch** procedures are required for this procedure to run.

         MsgBox strMessage 
         .Bookmark = varBookmark

      varBookmark = .Bookmark 
      .FindFirst strFind 
 
      ' If Find method fails, notify user and return to the  
      ' last current record. 
      If .NoMatch Then 
         strMessage = _ 
            "Not found! Returning to current record." &; _ 
            vbCr &; vbCr &; "NoMatch = " &; .NoMatch

The following example shows how to use the  **Seek** method to find a record in a linked table.
