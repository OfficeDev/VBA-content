# Form.RecordSelectors Property (Access)

You can use the  **RecordSelectors** property to specify whether a form displays record selectors in Form view. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RecordSelectors**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


## Remarks

The default value is  **True**.

You can use this property to remove record selectors when you create or use a form as a custom dialog box or a palette. You can also use this property for forms whose  **[DefaultView](bb44eca9-1576-794a-0558-f67e2d37559b.md)** property is set to Single Form.

The record selector displays the unsaved record indicator when a record is being edited. When the  **RecordSelectors** property is set to No and the **[RecordLocks](9080f7dd-259e-8b13-9648-3269bc7321d3.md)** property is set to Edited Record (record locking is "pessimistic" — only one person can edit a record at a time), there is no visual clue that the record is locked.


## Example

The following example specifies that no record has a record selector in the "Employees" form.


```vb
Forms("Employees").RecordSelectors = False
```
