# ODBC - insert on a linked table <table> failed. (Error 3155)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Using an ODBC connection, you tried to insert data into an ODBC database; that insertion could not be completed.

Possible causes:


- The insertion would have caused a rule violation.
    
- The ODBC database is read-only, or you do not have permission to insert data in that database. Resolve the read-only condition, or see your system administrator or the person who created the database to obtain the necessary permissions.
    
- The ODBC database is on a network drive, and you are not connected to the network. Make sure the network is available, and then try the operation again.
