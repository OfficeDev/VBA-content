# Could not write to file <name>. (Error 3180)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to export data to the specified text or spreadsheet file, but the file could not be modified.

Possible causes:


- Another user is currently accessing the file. Wait for the other user to finish using the file and then try the operation again.
    
- The file has been defined as read-only in the operating system or by your network. Resolve the read-only condition and then try the operation again.
    
- In a network environment, you do not have write privileges for the file.
    

You may need to contact your system administrator or network administrator.
