# Could not start session. (Error 3002)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to initiate an operation that requires a new session, but you have reached the limit of sessions that can be active at one time. Wait for other operations to finish or stop other operations, and then try the operation again.
