# There are no scheduled synchronizations between the two Synchronizers. (Error 3495)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The schedule between two Synchronizers has been deleted or you are attempting to set a schedule between the Synchronizer on your computer and itself. Use the Replication Manager to set the schedule with the correct Synchronizer.
