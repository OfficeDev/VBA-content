# The database has been placed in a state by an unknown user that prevents it from being opened or locked. (Error 3733)

This error occurs when the new passive shutdown/connection control is being used. This error indicates that another user set the database in a mode that will prevent other users from opening it. It is related to error #3734 and is used when the Microsoft Access database engine cannot determine which user invoked the passive shutdown/connection control.
