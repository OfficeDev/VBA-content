You can use the  **SetFilter** action to apply a filter to the records in the active datasheet, form, report, or table.

## Setting
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  **SetFilter** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _Filter Name_|If provided, the name of a query or of a filter saved as a query. This argument or the  _WhereCondition_ argument is required in a client database. In a Web database, this argument is not available.|
| _Where Condition_|If provided, a SQL WHERE clause that restricts the records in the datasheet, form, report, or table. In a Web database, this argument is required.|
| _Control Name_|If provided, the name of the control that corresponds to the subform or subreport to be filtered. If empty, the current object is filtered.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

In a web database, the  _Where Condition_ argument cannot begin with an equal sign (=).

When you run this action, the filter is applied to the table, form, report or datasheet (for example, query result) that is active and has the focus.

The  **Filter** property of the active object is used to save the _WhereCondition_ argument and apply it at a later time. Filters are saved with the objects in which they are created. They are automatically loaded when the object is opened, but they are not automatically applied.

In a client database, to automatically apply a filter when the object is opened, set the  **FilterOnLoad** property to **True**.

In a web database, to automatically apply a filter when the object is opened, add the  **SetFilter** action to a macro, and add the macro to the object's **OnLoad** event.


## Example

The following example shows how to use the  **SetFilter** action to filter the form in which the macro is defined.
