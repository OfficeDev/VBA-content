# There are no MAPI clients installed on this machine. Install a MAPI client, such as Outlook, on this machine. (Error 3804)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Microsoft Outlook/Exchange IISAM uses the Messaging API (MAPI) to obtain folder or address book information. To get MAPI onto your machine you must install one of the Microsoft e-mail clients that uses MAPI, such as Outlook Client, Outlook Express, or Exchange Client. Until you do this, the Outlook/Exchange IISAM cannot work.
