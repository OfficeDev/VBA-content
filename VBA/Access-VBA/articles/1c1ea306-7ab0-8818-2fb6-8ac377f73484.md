# Form.MaxRecords Property (Access)

Specifies the maximum number of records by a query or view. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **MaxRecords**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


## Remarks

When you set this property in Visual Basic you use the ADO  **MaxRecords** property.

Records are returned in the order specified by the query's ORDER BY clause.

You can use the  **MaxRecords** property in situations where limited system resources might prohibit a large number of returned records.


## Example

To return the  **MaxRecords** property for a form, you can use the following:


```vb
Dim l As Longl = Forms(formname).MaxRecords
```

To set the  **MaxRecords** property, you can use the following:




```vb
Forms(formname).MaxRecords = numrecords
```
