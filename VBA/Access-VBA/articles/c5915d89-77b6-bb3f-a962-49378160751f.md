# Step 6: Changes are Sent to the Server (RDS Tutorial)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

If the  **Recordset** object is edited, any changes (that is, rows that are added, changed, or deleted) can be sent back to the server.


 **Note**  The default behavior of RDS can be invoked implicitly with ADO objects and the Microsoft OLE DB Remoting Provider. Queries can return  **Recordset** s, and edited **Recordset** s can update the data source. This tutorial does not invoke RDS with ADO objects, but this is how it would look if it did:




```
 
Dim rs as New ADODB.Recordset 
rs.Open "SELECT * FROM Authors","Provider=MS Remote;Data Source=Pubs;" &; _ 
 "Remote Server=http://yourServer;Remote Provider=SQLOLEDB;" 
... ' Edit the Recordset. 
rs.UpdateBatch ' The equivalent of SubmitChanges. 
... 

```

 **Part A** Assume for this case that you have only used the[RDS.DataControl](ac430669-7628-696c-c036-b5d35405d788.md) and that a **Recordset** object is now associated with the **RDS.DataControl**. The[SubmitChanges](ecaea12d-7e1a-095d-17e7-d631ef230b90.md) method updates the data source with any changes to the **Recordset** object if the[Server](17519dbe-a43a-1d0d-22c1-dc0def2f63ab.md) and[Connect](11aa3284-18e9-6d2d-761b-c25090370b77.md) properties are still set.



```vb
Sub RDSTutorial6A() 
  Dim DC as New RDS.DataControl 
  Dim RS as ADODB.Recordset 
  DC.Server = "http://yourServer" 
  DC.Connect = "DSN=Pubs" 
  DC.SQL = "SELECT * FROM Authors" 
  DC.Refresh 
  '... 
  Set RS = DC.Recordset 
  ' Edit the Recordset. 
  '... 
  DC.SubmitChanges 
  '... 
End Sub
```

 **Part B** Alternatively, you could update the server with the[RDSServer.DataFactory](1de76cdd-34dc-8547-29aa-48ad6067bdea.md) object, specifying a connection and a **Recordset** object.



```vb
 
Sub RDSTutorial6B() 
Dim DS As New RDS.DataSpace 
Dim RS As ADODB.Recordset 
Dim DC As New RDS.DataControl 
Dim DF As Object 
Dim blnStatus As Boolean 
Set DF = DS.CreateObject("RDSServer.DataFactory", "http://yourServer") 
Set RS = DF.Query ("DSN=Pubs", "SELECT * FROM Authors") 
DC.SourceRecordset = RS ' Visual controls can now bind to DC. 
 ' Edit the Recordset. 
blnStatus = DF.SubmitChanges "DSN=Pubs", RS 
End Sub
```

 **This is the end of the tutorial.**
