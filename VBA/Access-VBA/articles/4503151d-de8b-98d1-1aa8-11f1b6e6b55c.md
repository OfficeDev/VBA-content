# Step 4: Server Returns the Recordset (RDS Tutorial)

RDS converts the retrieved  **Recordset** object to a form that can be sent back to the client (that is, it _marshals_ the **Recordset** ). The exact form of the conversion and how it is sent depends on whether the server is on the Internet or an intranet, a local area network, or is a dynamic-link library. However, this detail is not critical; all that matters is that RDS sends the **Recordset** back to the client.

On the client side, a  **Recordset** object is returned and assigned to a local variable.



```vb
Sub RDSTutorial4() 
 Dim DS as New RDS.DataSpace 
 Dim RS as ADODB.Recordset 
 Dim DF as Object 
 Set DF = DS.CreateObject("RDSServer.DataFactory", "http://yourServer") 
 Set RS = DF.Query("DSN=Pubs", "SELECT * FROM Authors") 
'... 
End Sub
```
