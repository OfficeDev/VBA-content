## Step 4: Populate the Details Text Box

 **To populate the Details text box**

Create a new subroutine named recFields and insert the following code:




```vb
Sub recFields(r As Record, l As ListBox, t As TextBox) 
    Dim f As Field 
    Dim s As Stream 
    Set s = New Stream 
    Dim str As String 
     
    For Each f In r.Fields 
        l.AddItem f.Name &; ": " &; f.Value 
    Next 
    t.Text = "" 
    If r!RESOURCE_CONTENTCLASS = "text/plain" Then 
        s.Open r, adModeRead, adOpenStreamFromRecord 
        str = s.ReadText(1) 
        s.Position = 0 
        If Asc(Mid(str, 1, 1)) = 63 Then '//63 = "?" 
            s.Charset = "ascii" 
            s.Type = adTypeText 
        End If 
        t.Text = s.ReadText(adReadAll) 
    End If 
End Sub
```

This code populates lstDetails with the fields and values of the simple record passed to recFields. If the resource is a text file, a text  **Stream** is opened from the resource record. The code determines if the character set is ASCII and copies the **Stream** contents into txtDetails.
