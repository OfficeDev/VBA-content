With the collections, methods, and properties of a  **Command** object, you can do the following:


- Define the executable text of the command (for example, a SQL statement or a stored procedure) by using the  **CommandText** property.
    
- Define parameterized queries or stored procedure arguments by using  **Parameter** objects and the **Parameters** collection.
    
- Execute a command and return a  **Recordset** object, if appropriate, by using the **Execute** method.
    
- Specify the type of command by using the  **CommandType** property prior to execution to optimize performance.
    
- Control whether the provider saves a prepared (or compiled) version of the command prior to execution by using the  **Prepared** property.
    
- Set the number of seconds that a provider will wait for a command to execute by using the  **CommandTimeout** property.
    
- Associate an open connection with a  **Command** object by setting its **ActiveConnection** property.
    
- Set the  **Name** property to identify the **Command** object as a method on the associated **Connection** object.
    
- Pass a  **Command** object to the **Source** property of a **Recordset** in order to obtain data.
