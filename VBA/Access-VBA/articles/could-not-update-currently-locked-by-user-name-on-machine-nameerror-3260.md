# Could not update; currently locked by user <name> on machine <name>. (Error 3260)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to update data that is located on a page that is currently locked.

Possible causes:


- You tried to save a query being used by someone else. To save your query, wait for the other user to finish or enter a different name, and then try the operation again.
    
- You tried to use the  **Edit** method on a data page containing a record that is already open or locked.
