# Cannot perform cascading operation. It would result in a null key in table <name>. (Error 3398)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The cascade operation you are attempting would result in a  **Null** value in a primary key field in the indicated table, which has been set up not to allow **Null** values. Check the values you are attempting to update and fix them so they do not result in **Null** values.
