# Named Commands

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can set the  **Name** property on a **Command** object and then execute the command by calling it as if it were a method on the **Command** object **ActiveConnection** property. This is illustrated in the following example, in which the command is named _GetCustomers_. Notice that the code passes in a declared and instantiated **Recordset** object to the GetCustomers "method." You can also pass in parameters to the "method" if they are required by the **Command**.




```vb
'BeginNamedCmd 
 On Error GoTo ErrHandler: 
 
 Dim objConn As New ADODB.Connection 
 Dim objCmd As New ADODB.Command 
 Dim objRs As New ADODB.Recordset 
 
 ' Connect to the data source. 
 Set objConn = GetNewConnection 
 
 objCmd.CommandText = "SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers" 
 objCmd.CommandType = adCmdText 
 
 'Name the command. 
 objCmd.Name = "GetCustomers" 
 
 objCmd.ActiveConnection = objConn 
 
 ' Execute using Command.Name from the Connection. 
 objConn.GetCustomers objRs 
 
 ' Display. 
 Do While Not objRs.EOF 
 Debug.Print objRs(0) &; vbTab &; objRs(1) 
 objRs.MoveNext 
 Loop 
 
 'clean up 
 objRs.Close 
 objConn.Close 
 Set objRs = Nothing 
 Set objConn = Nothing 
 Set objCmd = Nothing 
 Exit Sub 
 
ErrHandler: 
 'clean up 
 If objRs.State = adStateOpen Then 
 objRs.Close 
 End If 
 
 If objConn.State = adStateOpen Then 
 objConn.Close 
 End If 
 
 Set objRs = Nothing 
 Set objConn = Nothing 
 Set objCmd = Nothing 
 
 If Err <> 0 Then 
 MsgBox Err.Source &; "-->" &; Err.Description, , "Error" 
 End If 
'EndNamedCmd 

```
