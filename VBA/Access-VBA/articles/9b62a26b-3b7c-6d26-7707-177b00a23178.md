# QueryDefs.Append Method (DAO)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Adds a new  **QueryDef** to the **QueryDefs** collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Append**( ** _Object_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **QueryDefs** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Object_|Required|**Object**|An object variable that represents the field being appended to the collection.|

## Remarks

The appended object becomes a persistent object, stored on disk, until you delete it by using the  **Delete** method.

The addition of a new object occurs immediately, but you should use the  **Refresh** method on any other collections that may be affected by changes to the database structure.

If the object you're appending isn't complete (such as when you haven't appended any  **Field** objects to a **Fields** collection of an **Index** object before it's appended to an **Indexes** collection) or if the properties set in one or more subordinate objects are incorrect, using the **Append** method causes an error. For example, if you haven't specified a field type and then try to append the **Field** object to the **Fields** collection in a **TableDef** object, using the **Append** method triggers a run-time error.
