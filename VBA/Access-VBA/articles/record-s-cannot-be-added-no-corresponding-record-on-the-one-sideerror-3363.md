# Record(s) cannot be added; no corresponding record on the 'one' side. (Error 3363)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This error occurs when you edit a stored query or view that contains more than one table. This error could occur if you tried to save a row from a view that was a join between a customer (single) and orders (many) table. If you entered information regarding the order only and did not enter information, such as the primary key value, for the customer table this error would be returned.
