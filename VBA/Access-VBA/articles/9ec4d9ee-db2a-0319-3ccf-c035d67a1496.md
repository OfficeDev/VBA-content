    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
    strSql = "PROCEDURE CategoryList; " _ 
        &; "SELECT DISTINCTROW CategoryName, " _ 
        &; "CategoryID FROM Categories " _ 
        &; "ORDER BY CategoryName;" 
     
    ' Create a named QueryDef based on the SQL 
    ' statement. 
    Set qdf = dbs.CreateQueryDef("NewQry", strSql) 
 
    ' Create a temporary snapshot-type Recordset. 
    Set rst = qdf.OpenRecordset(dbOpenSnapshot) 
 
    ' Populate the Recordset. 
    rst.MoveLast 
             
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the  
    ' Recordset. Pass the Recordset object and desired 
    ' field width. 
    Execute EnumFields rst, 15 
     
    ' Delete the QueryDef because this is a 
    ' demonstration. 
    dbs.QueryDefs.Delete "NewQry" 
     
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
