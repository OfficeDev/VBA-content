# TextBox Object (Access)

This object represents a text box control on a form or report. Text boxes are used to either display data from a record source, or to display the results of a calculation, or to accept input from a user.


## Example

The following code example uses a form with a text box to receive user input. The code displays a message when the user inputs data and then presses Return


```vb

Private Sub txtValue1_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)

MsgBox "The Text box is being updated."

End Sub
```


## Remarks

Text boxes can be either bound or unbound. You use a bound text box to display data from a particular field. You use an unbound text box to display the results of a calculation, or to accept input from a user (as in the code example above).
