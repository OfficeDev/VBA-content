# SubForm.StatusBarText Property (Access)

You can use the  **StatusBarText** property to specify the text that is displayed in the status bar when a control is selected. Read/write **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **StatusBarText**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **SubForm** object.


## Remarks

 **Note**  The length of the text you can display in the status bar depends on your computer hardware and video display.

 **Note**  You can also use the  **ControlTipText** property to display a ScreenTip for a control.

If you create a control by dragging a field from the field list, the value in a field's  **Description** property is copied to the **StatusBarText** property.


## Example

The following example sets the status bar text to be displayed when the "Address_TextBox" control in the "Mailing List" form has the focus in Form View. 


```vb
Forms("Mailing List").Controls("Address_TextBox"). _ 
 StatusBarText = "Enter the company's mailing address." 

```
