# The replication property you are attempting to set or delete is read-only and cannot be changed. (Error 3461)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Many properties related to replication are for internal use only or are available to the developer on a read-only basis. Review your program code to make sure you are reading rather than changing the property.
