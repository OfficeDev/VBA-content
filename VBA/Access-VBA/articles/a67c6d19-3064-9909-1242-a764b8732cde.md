The  **HideDuplicates** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Description**|

You can use the  **HideDuplicates** property to create a grouped report by using only the detail section rather than a group header and the detail section.

```vb
Dim intCurVal As Integer 
intCurVal = Me!CategoryName.HideDuplicates
```
