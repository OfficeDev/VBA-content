### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Name_|Required|**String**|A  **String** that uniquely names the new **Workspace** object. See the **[Name](5f4a95cd-63a3-aedf-df64-793158b2283d.md)** property for details on valid **Workspace** names.|
| _UserName_|Required|**String**|A  **String** that identifies the owner of the new **Workspace** object. See the **UserName** property for more information.|
| _Password_|Required|**String**|A  **String** containing the password for the new **Workspace** object. The password can be up to 20 characters long and can include any characters except ASCII character 0 (null).
 **Note**  Use strong passwords that combine upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Weak passwords don't mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Use a strong password that you can remember so that you don't have to write it down.

| _UseType_|Optional|**Variant**|One of the  **[WorkspaceTypeEnum](c660a0a9-b0ae-a7be-5635-761d3a05a4ef.md)** values.
 **Note**  ODBCDirect workspaces are not supported in Microsoft Access 2013. Setting the type argument to  **dbUseODBC** will result in a run-time error. Use ADO if you want to access external data sources without using the Microsoft Access database engine.

### Return Value

Workspace


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Once you use the  **CreateWorkspace** method to create a new **Workspace** object, a **Workspace** session is started, and you can refer to the **Workspace** object in your application.

 **Workspace** objects aren't permanent, and you can't save them to disk. Once you create a **Workspace** object, you can't alter any of its property settings, except for the **Name** property, which you can modify before appending the **Workspace** object to the **[Workspaces](88b851ce-4180-964f-582e-bc9571bf554c.md)** collection.

You don't have to append the new  **Workspace** object to a collection before you can use it. You append a newly created **Workspace** object only if you need to refer to it through the **Workspaces** collection.

To remove a  **Workspace** object from the **Workspaces** collection, close all open databases and connections and then use the **[Close](9b1a77cb-da12-24d6-892f-a56be103d51d.md)** method on the **Workspace** object.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **CreateWorkspace** method to createMicrosoft Access workspace. It then lists the properties of the workspace.


```vb
Sub CreateWorkspaceX() 
 
   Dim wrkAcc As Workspace 
   Dim wrkLoop As Workspace 
   Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
   DefaultType = dbUseJet 
   ' Create an unnamed Workspace object of the type  
   ' specified by the DefaultType property of DBEngine  
   ' (dbUseJet). 
   Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("", "admin", "") 
 
   ' Enumerate Workspaces collection. 
   Debug.Print "Workspace objects in Workspaces collection:" 
   For Each wrkLoop In Workspaces 
      Debug.Print "  " &; wrkLoop.Name 
   Next wrkLoop 
 
   With wrkAcc 
      ' Enumerate Properties collection of Microsoft Access  
      ' workspace. 
      Debug.Print _ 
         "Properties of unnamed Microsoft Access workspace" 
      On Error Resume Next 
      For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
         Debug.Print "  " &; prpLoop.Name &; " = " &; prpLoop 
      Next prpLoop 
      On Error GoTo 0 
   End With 
 
   wrkAcc.Close 
 
End Sub
```
