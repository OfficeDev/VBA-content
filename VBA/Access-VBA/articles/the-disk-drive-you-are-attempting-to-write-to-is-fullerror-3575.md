# The disk drive you are attempting to write to is full. (Error 3575)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The disk drive does not have enough space to complete the operation. Delete unneeded files from the disk to create sufficient space for the operation. Make space available on the disk larger than the file you are attempting to save.
