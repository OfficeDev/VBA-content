Returns a value that indicates whether an object supports transactions. Read-only  **Boolean**.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Transactions**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

In a Microsoft Access workspace, you can also use the  **Transactions** property with dynaset- or table-type **Recordset** objects. Snapshot- and forward-only-type **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** objects always return **False**.

If a dynaset- or table-type  **Recordset** is based on a Microsoft Access database engine table, the **Transactions** property is **True** and you can use transactions. Other database engines may not support transactions. For example, you can't use transactions in a dynaset-type **Recordset** object based on a Paradox table.

Check the  **Transactions** property before using the **[BeginTrans](fdde662f-2472-3af6-67d6-c8ca7fb1dca7.md)** method on the **Recordset** object's **[Workspace](bf3ab863-5e9a-4842-1f82-2ccf958d9779.md)** object to make sure that transactions are supported. Using the **BeginTrans**, **CommitTrans**, or **Rollback** methods on an unsupported object has no effect.


## Example

This example demonstrates the  **Transactions** property in Microsoft Access workspaces.


```vb
Sub TransactionsX() 
 
 Dim wrkAcc As Workspace 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim conPubs As Connection 
 Dim rstTemp As Recordset 
 
 Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("", "admin", "", dbUseJet) 
 Set dbsNorthwind = wrkAcc.OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 ' Open two different Recordset objects and display the 
 ' Transactions property of each. 
 
 Debug.Print "Opening Microsoft Access table-type " &; _ 
 "recordset..." 
 Set rstTemp = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "Employees", dbOpenTable) 
 Debug.Print " Transactions = " &; rstTemp.Transactions 
 
 Debug.Print "Opening forward-only-type " &; _ 
 "recordset where the source is an SQL statement..." 
 Set rstTemp = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "SELECT * FROM Employees", dbOpenForwardOnly) 
 Debug.Print " Transactions = " &; rstTemp.Transactions 
 
 rstTemp.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 conPubs.Close 
 wrkAcc.Close 
End Sub
```
