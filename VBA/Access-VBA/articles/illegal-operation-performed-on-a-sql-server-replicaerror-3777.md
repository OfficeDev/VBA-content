# Illegal Operation performed on a SQL Server Replica. (Error 3777)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Many operations cannot be executed from Microsoft SQL replicas. For example, you cannot delete or rename a table, add, delete, or rename a column in a table, make a local table replicable, exchange with another Jet Subscriber in the SQL replica set, or execute an exchange with the SQL Publication in any manner other than a Direct synchronization.
