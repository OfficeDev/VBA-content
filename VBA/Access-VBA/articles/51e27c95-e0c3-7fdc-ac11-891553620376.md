# The Limits of a Recordset

Use the  **BOF** and **EOF** properties to determine whether a **Recordset** object contains records or whether you've gone beyond the limits of a **Recordset** object when you move from record to record. Think of **BOF** and **EOF** as "phantom" records that are positioned at the beginning and end of the **Recordset**. Building on the sample **Recordset** from[Examining Data](73c69134-3127-3344-d5c3-5ecb9e0e958b.md), it would now look like this:



|**ProductID**|**ProductName**|**UnitPrice**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|BOF|
|
|
|7|Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears|30.0000|
|14|Tofu|23.2500|
|28|Rssle Sauerkraut|45.6000|
|51|Manjimup Dried Apples|53.0000|
|74|Longlife Tofu|10.0000|
|EOF|
|
|
The  **BOF** property returns **True** (-1) if the current record position is before the first record and **False** (0) if the current record position is on or after the first record.
The  **EOF** property returns **True** if the current record position is after the last record and **False** if the current record position is on or before the last record.
If either the  **BOF** or **EOF** property is **True**, there is no current record, as shown in the following code:



```vb
 
If oRs.BOF And oRs.EOF Then 
 ' Command returned no records. 
End If 

```

If you open a  **Recordset** object containing no records, the **BOF** and **EOF** properties are both set to **True** and the value of the **Recordset** object's **RecordCount** property setting depends on the cursor type. -1 will be returned for dynamic cursors ( **CursorType** = **adOpenDynamic** ) and 0 will be returned for other cursors.
When you open a  **Recordset** object that contains at least one record, the first record is the current record and the **BOF** and **EOF** properties are **False**.
If you delete the last remaining record in the  **Recordset** object, the cursor is left in an indeterminate state. The **BOF** and **EOF** properties may remain **False** until you attempt to reposition the current record, depending upon the provider.
