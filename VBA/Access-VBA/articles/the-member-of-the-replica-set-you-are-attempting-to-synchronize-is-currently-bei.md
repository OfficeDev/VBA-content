# The member of the replica set you are attempting to synchronize is currently being used in another synchronization. (Error 3510)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Design Master or a replica can be involved in only one synchronization at a time. Although you cannot initiate a second synchronization while the member is locked, you can continue using it. Wait a few minutes and try your synchronization again.
