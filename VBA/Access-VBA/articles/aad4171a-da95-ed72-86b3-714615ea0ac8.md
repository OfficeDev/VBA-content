## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Update**( ** _UpdateType_**, ** _Force_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _UpdateType_|Optional|**Long**|A  **[UpdateTypeEnum](7ac38bae-27fc-f3d0-5b75-569bce547954.md)** constant indicating the type of update, as specified in Settings (ODBCDirect workspaces only).|
| _Force_|Optional|**Boolean**| A **Boolean** value indicating whether or not to force the changes into the database, regardless of whether the underlying data has been changed by another user since the **[AddNew](18cb35f6-8652-fb20-2460-3d13fae39d23.md)**, **[Delete](a8e249e7-7526-3eff-a5cf-70cab2081970.md)**, or **[Edit](a64d601b-f446-da40-0020-b99110a72872.md)** call. If **True**, the changes are forced and changes made by other users are simply overwritten. If **False** (default), changes made by another user while the update is pending will cause the update to fail for those changes that are in conflict. No error occurs, but the **[BatchCollisionCount](9d166463-8313-c0f5-8389-5d5ad933eb33.md)** and **[BatchCollisions](53e5572b-770c-9ea5-31a5-984abdf66faa.md)** properties will indicate the number of conflicts and the rows affected by conflicts, respectively (ODBCDirect workspaces only).|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use  **Update** to save the current record and any changes you've made to it.


 **Important**  Changes to the current record are lost if:




- You use the  **Edit** or **AddNew** method, and then move to another record without first using **Update**.
    
- You use  **Edit** or **AddNew**, and then use **Edit** or **AddNew** again without first using **Update**.
    
- You set the  **[Bookmark](c4b1c2d9-668e-e365-544c-efb4ae4efcc9.md)** property to another record.
    
- You close the  **Recordset** without first using **Update**.
    
- You cancel the  **Edit** operation by using **[CancelUpdate](efc4f60b-876f-5e11-37fd-0fbbf225b15b.md)**.
    


To edit a record, use the  **Edit** method to copy the contents of the current record to the copy buffer. If you don't use **Edit** first, an error occurs when you use **Update** or attempt to change a field's value.

In an ODBCDirect workspace, you can do batch updates, provided the cursor library supports batch updates, and the  **Recordset** was opened with the optimistic batch locking option.

In a Microsoft Access workspace, when the  **Recordset** object's **LockEdits** property setting is **True** (pessimistically locked) in a multiuser environment, the record remains locked from the time **Edit** is used until the **Update** method is executed or the edit is canceled. If the **LockEdits** property setting is **False** (optimistically locked), the record is locked and compared with the pre-edited record just before it is updated in the database. If the record has changed since you used the **Edit** method, the **Update** operation fails. Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC and installable ISAM databases always use optimistic locking. To continue the **Update** operation with your changes, use the **Update** method again. To revert to the record as the other user changed it, refresh the current record by using `Move 0`.




 **Note**  To add, edit, or delete a record, there must be a unique index on the record in the underlying data source. If not, a "Permission denied" error will occur on the  **AddNew**, **Delete**, or **Edit** method call in a Microsoft Access workspace, or an "Invalid argument" error will occur on the **Update** call in an ODBCDirect workspace.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example demonstrates the  **Update** method in conjunction with **Edit** method.


```vb
Sub UpdateX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim strOldFirst As String 
 Dim strOldLast As String 
 Dim strMessage As String 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees") 
 
 With rstEmployees 
 .Edit 
 ' Store original data. 
 strOldFirst = !FirstName 
 strOldLast = !LastName 
 ' Change data in edit buffer. 
 !FirstName = "Linda" 
 !LastName = "Kobara" 
 
 ' Show contents of buffer and get user input. 
 strMessage = "Edit in progress:" &; vbCr &; _ 
 " Original data = " &; strOldFirst &; " " &; _ 
 strOldLast &; vbCr &; " Data in buffer = " &; _ 
 !FirstName &; " " &; !LastName &; vbCr &; vbCr &; _ 
 "Use Update to replace the original data with " &; _ 
 "the buffered data in the Recordset?" 
 
 If MsgBox(strMessage, vbYesNo) = vbYes Then 
 .Update 
 Else 
 .CancelUpdate 
 End If 
 
 ' Show the resulting data. 
 MsgBox "Data in recordset = " &; !FirstName &; " " &; _ 
 !LastName 
 
 ' Restore original data because this is a demonstration. 
 If Not (strOldFirst = !FirstName And _ 
 strOldLast = !LastName) Then 
 .Edit 
 !FirstName = strOldFirst 
 !LastName = strOldLast 
 .Update 
 End If 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub
```

This example demonstrates the  **Update** method in conjunction with the **AddNew** method.




```vb
Sub UpdateX2() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim strOldFirst As String 
 Dim strOldLast As String 
 Dim strMessage As String 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees") 
 
 With rstEmployees 
 .AddNew 
 !FirstName = "Bill" 
 !LastName = "Sornsin" 
 
 ' Show contents of buffer and get user input. 
 strMessage = "AddNew in progress:" &; vbCr &; _ 
 " Data in buffer = " &; !FirstName &; " " &; _ 
 !LastName &; vbCr &; vbCr &; _ 
 "Use Update to save buffer to recordset?" 
 
 If MsgBox(strMessage, vbYesNoCancel) = vbYes Then 
 .Update 
 ' Go to the new record and show the resulting data. 
 .Bookmark = .LastModified 
 MsgBox "Data in recordset = " &; !FirstName &; _ 
 " " &; !LastName 
 ' Delete new data because this is a demonstration. 
 .Delete 
 Else 
 .CancelUpdate 
 MsgBox "No new record added." 
 End If 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub
```

This example uses the  **BatchCollisionCount** property and the **Update** method to demonstrate batch updating where any collisions are resolved by forcing the batch update.




```vb
Sub BatchX() 
 
 Dim wrkMain As Workspace 
 Dim conMain As Connection 
 Dim rstTemp As Recordset 
 Dim intLoop As Integer 
 Dim strPrompt As String 
 
 Set wrkMain = CreateWorkspace("ODBCWorkspace", _ 
 "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
 ' This DefaultCursorDriver setting is required for 
 ' batch updating. 
 wrkMain.DefaultCursorDriver = dbUseClientBatchCursor 
 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 Set conMain = wrkMain.OpenConnection("Publishers", _ 
 dbDriverNoPrompt, False, _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
 
 ' The following locking argument is required for 
 ' batch updating. It is also required that a table 
 ' with a primary key is used. 
 Set rstTemp = conMain.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "SELECT * FROM roysched", dbOpenDynaset, 0, _ 
 dbOptimisticBatch) 
 
 With rstTemp 
 ' Modify data in local recordset. 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 .Edit 
 If !royalty <= 20 Then 
 !royalty = !royalty - 4 
 Else 
 !royalty = !royalty + 2 
 End If 
 .Update 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 
 ' Attempt a batch update. 
 .Update dbUpdateBatch 
 
 ' If there are collisions, give the user the option 
 ' of forcing the changes or resolving them 
 ' individually. 
 If .BatchCollisionCount > 0 Then 
 strPrompt = "There are collisions. " &; vbCr &; _ 
 "Do you want the program to force " &; _ 
 vbCr &; "an update using the local data?" 
 If MsgBox(strPrompt, vbYesNo) = vbYes Then _ 
 .Update dbUpdateBatch, True 
 End If 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 conMain.Close 
 wrkMain.Close 
 
End Sub
```

This example uses the  **AddNew** method to create a new record with the specified name. The AddName function is required for this procedure to run.




```vb
Sub AddNewX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim strFirstName As String 
 Dim strLastName As String 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset) 
 
 ' Get data from the user. 
 strFirstName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
 "Enter first name:")) 
 strLastName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
 "Enter last name:")) 
 
 ' Proceed only if the user actually entered something 
 ' for both the first and last names. 
 If strFirstName <> "" and strLastName <> "" Then 
 
 ' Call the function that adds the record. 
 AddName rstEmployees, strFirstName, strLastName 
 
 ' Show the newly added data. 
 With rstEmployees 
 Debug.Print "New record: " &; !FirstName &; _ 
 " " &; !LastName 
 ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
 .Delete 
 End With 
 
 Else 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "You must input a string for first and last name!" 
 End If 
 
 rstEmployees.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Function AddName(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
 strFirst As String, strLast As String) 
 
 ' Adds a new record to a Recordset using the data passed 
 ' by the calling procedure. The new record is then made 
 ' the current record. 
 With rstTemp 
 .AddNew 
 !FirstName = strFirst 
 !LastName = strLast 
 .Update 
 .Bookmark = .LastModified 
 End With 
 
End Function
```
