 _expression_. **Expression**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Field2** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

In Access 2013, you can create table fields that calculate values. The calculations can include values from fields in the same table as well as built-in Access functions.

The calculation cannot include fields from other tables or queries.

The results of the calculation are read-only.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

The following example shows how to create a calculated field. The  **CreateField** method creates a field named **FullName**. The  **Expression** property is then set to the expression that calculates the value of the field.

```vb
Sub CreateCalculatedField()
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
    Dim fld As DAO.Field2
    
    ' get the database
    Set dbs = CurrentDb()
    
    ' create the table
    Set tdf = dbs.CreateTableDef("tblContactsCalcField")
    
    ' create the fields: first name, last name
    tdf.Fields.Append tdf.CreateField("FirstName", dbText, 20)
    tdf.Fields.Append tdf.CreateField("LastName", dbText, 20)
    
    ' create the calculated field: full name
    Set fld = tdf.CreateField("FullName", dbText, 50)
    fld.Expression = "[FirstName] &; "" "" &; [LastName]"
    tdf.Fields.Append fld
    
    ' append the table and cleanup
    dbs.TableDefs.Append tdf
    
Cleanup:
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set tdf = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Sub
