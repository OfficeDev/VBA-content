# Initializing the Microsoft Excel Driver

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

When you install the Microsoft® Excel driver, the Setup program writes a set of default values to the Microsoft Windows® Registry in the Engines and ISAM Formats subkeys. You should not modify these settings directly; use the setup program for your application to add, remove, or change these settings. The following sections describe initialization and ISAM Format settings for the Microsoft Excel database driver.


## Microsoft Excel Initialization Settings

The  **Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Excel** folder includes initialization settings for the Aceexcl.dll driver, used for external access to Microsoft Excel worksheets. Typical settings for the entries in this folder are shown in the following example.


```text
win32=<path>\ Aceexcl.dll  

TypeGuessRows=8 

ImportMixedTypes=Text 

AppendBlankRows=1 

FirstRowHasNames=Yes
```

The Microsoft Access database engine uses the Excel folder entries as follows.



|**Entry**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|win32|The location of msexcl40.dll. The full path is determined at the time of installation. Values are of type REG_SZ.|
|TypeGuessRows|The number of rows to be checked for the data type. The data type is determined given the maximum number of kinds of data found. If there is a tie, the data type is determined in the following order: Number, Currency, Date, Text, Boolean. If data is encountered that does not match the data type guessed for the column, it is returned as a  **Null** value. On import, if a column has mixed data types, the entire column will be cast according to the ImportMixedTypes setting. The default number of rows to be checked is 8. Values are of type REG_DWORD.|
|ImportMixedTypes|Can be set to MajorityType or Text. If set to MajorityType, columns of mixed data types will be cast to the predominate data type on import. If set to Text, columns of mixed data types will be cast to Text on import. The default is Text. Values are of type REG_SZ.|
|AppendBlankRows|The number of blank rows to be appended to the end of a Version 3.5 or Version 4.0 worksheet before new data is added. For example, if AppendBlankRows is set to 4, Microsoft Jet will append 4 blank rows to the end of the worksheet before appending rows that contain data. Integer values for this setting can range from 0 to 16; the default is 01 (one additional row appended). Values are of type REG_DWORD.|
|FirstRowHasNames|A binary value that indicates whether the first row of the table contains column names. A value of 01 indicates that, during import, column names are taken from the first row. A value of 00 indicates no column names in the first row; column names appear as F1, F2, F3, and so on. The default is 01. Values are of type REG_BINARY.|
The  **Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Excel 8.0** folder contains the following entries, which apply to Microsoft Excel 97.



|**Entry name**|**Type**|**Value**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Engine|REG_SZ|Excel|
|ExportFilter|REG_SZ|Microsoft Excel 97-2000 (*.xls)|
|CanLink|REG_BINARY|01|
|OneTablePerFile|REG_BINARY|00|
|IsamType|REG_DWORD|1|
|IndexDialog|REG_BINARY|00|
|CreateDBOnExport|REG_BINARY|01|
|ResultTextExport|REG_SZ|Export data from the current database into a Microsoft Excel 97 file. This process will overwrite the data if exported to an existing file.|
|SupportsLongNames|REG_BINARY|01|

 **Note**  When you change Windows Registry settings, you must exit and then restart the database engine for the new settings to take effect.
