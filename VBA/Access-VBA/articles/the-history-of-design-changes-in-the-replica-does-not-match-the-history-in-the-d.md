# The history of design changes in the replica does not match the history in the Design Master. (Error 3524)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Synchronizer is unable to synchronize the two members of the replica set because the history of design (or schema) changes is different for each replica. The discrepancy in design history might be caused by either the existence of two Design Masters or because the Design Master has been restored from a backup made sometime in the past.
