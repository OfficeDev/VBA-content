The following example shows how to fabricate a hierarchical Recordset without an underlying data source by using the data shaping grammar to define columns for parent, child, and grandchild  **Recordsets**.
To fabricate a hierarchical  **Recordset**, you must specify the Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB (MSDataShape), and you may specify a Data Provider value of NONE in the connection string parameter of the[Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) object's[Open](1adaa17d-dfe1-22e0-3415-720516d138f8.md) method. For more information, see[Required Providers for Data Shaping](eb8933fb-d533-3ea7-e045-35c1ca585765.md).



```vb
Dim cn As New ADODB.Connection
Dim rsCustomers As New ADODB.Recordset

cn.Open "Provider=MSDataShape;Data Provider=NONE;"
 
strShape = _
"SHAPE APPEND NEW adInteger AS CustID," &; _
            " NEW adChar(25) AS FirstName," &; _
            " NEW adChar(25) AS LastName," &; _
            " NEW adChar(12) AS SSN," &; _
            " NEW adChar(50) AS Address," &; _
         " ((SHAPE APPEND NEW adChar(80) AS VIN_NO," &; _
                        " NEW adInteger AS CustID," &; _
                        " NEW adChar(20) AS BodyColor, " &; _
                     " ((SHAPE APPEND NEW adChar(80) AS VIN_NO," &; _
                                    " NEW adChar(20) AS Make, " &; _
                                    " NEW adChar(20) AS Model," &; _
                                    " NEW adChar(4) AS Year) " &; _
                        " AS VINS RELATE VIN_NO TO VIN_NO))" &; _
            " AS Vehicles RELATE CustID TO CustID) "
 
rsCustomers.Open strShape, cn, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic, -1

```

Once the  **Recordset** has been fabricated, it can be populated, manipulated, or persisted to a file.
