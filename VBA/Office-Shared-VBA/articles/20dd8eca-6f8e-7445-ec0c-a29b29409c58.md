# COMAddIn.Object Property (Office)

Gets or sets an object reference. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Object**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **COMAddIn** object.


## Remarks

The  **Object** property is a read/write property in which any object reference can be stored. In this regard, it is similar to the general-purpose **Tag** property of certain ActiveX controls.

In some cases, the  **Object** property returns the object represented by the specified **COMAddIn** object; otherwise, it returns **Nothing** by default.


## Example

The following example returns the object represented by the COM add-in  **msodraa9.ShapeSelect**.


```
Dim objBaseObject As Object 
Set objBaseObject = _ 
 Application.COMAddIns.Item("msodraa9.ShapeSelect").Object
```
