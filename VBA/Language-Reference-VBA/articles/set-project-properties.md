# Set Project Properties

 **To set Project Properties**



1. From the  **Tools** menu, choose **&lt;projectname&gt;** **Properties**
    
2. Use the  **General** tab in the **&lt;projectname> Properties** dialog box to specify the following:
    
    
    
      - Name of your project.
    
  - Description of your [project](vbe-glossary.md).
    
  - Name of the Help file associated with your project.
    
  - Context ID for the specific Help topic to be called when the user clicks the  **Help** button while the application's[object library](vbe-glossary.md) is selected in the **Object Browser**.
    

    
    
3. Use the  **Protection** tab in the **&lt;projectname> Properties** dialog box to lock the project from viewing by others and specify a password for access to project properties. After you set protection, you must save and close your project for the protection to take effect. (Note your project must contain VBA code and/or a custom form in order to retain this password.)
