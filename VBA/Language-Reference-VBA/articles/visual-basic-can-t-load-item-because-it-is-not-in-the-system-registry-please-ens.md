# Visual Basic can't load 'item' because it is not in the system registry. Please ensure that all add-ins have been installed correctly.

Visual Basic couldn't load the [add-in](vbe-glossary.md) that you tried to select from the **Available Add-Ins** list in the **Add-In Manager** dialog box, because it was not registered properly or is no longer registered in the system[registry](vbe-glossary.md).
