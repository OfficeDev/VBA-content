# Line 'item1': Can't set Shortcut property in menu 'item2'. Parent menu cannot have a shortcut key.

A top-level  **Menu** control appeared in the ASCII form file with a shortcut key defined. Top-level menus can't have a shortcut key. The **Menu** control will be loaded, but its **Shortcut** property won't be set.
