- An attempt has been made to call a procedure in a [dynamic-link library (DLL)](vbe-glossary.md), but the library or resource file name specified in the  **Lib** clause of the **Declare** statement can't be found.
    
    Check the spelling of the file name and the path specification.
    
- In the development environment, this error occurs if you attempt to open a [project](vbe-glossary.md) or load a text file that doesn't exist.
