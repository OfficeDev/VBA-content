# Item' could not be loaded

Syntax errors are preventing Visual Basic from parsing and loading a file, or form name conflicts prevent loading of an ASCII form. The form won't be loaded and the form name won't be displayed in the  **Project Explorer**.

Make sure that the file causing this error is a valid ASCII form in the correct format and that no conflicts exist among the different forms in the [project](vbe-glossary.md).
