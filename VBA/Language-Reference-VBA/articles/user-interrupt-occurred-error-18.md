# User interrupt occurred (Error 18)

The process of breaking execution is useful, but if left unhandled, it results in termination of the application. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A user pressed CTRL+BREAK or another interrupt key. In the [development environment](vbe-glossary.md), continue execution. To provide for the occurrence of this condition at [run time](vbe-glossary.md), handle the error in an appropriate way.
