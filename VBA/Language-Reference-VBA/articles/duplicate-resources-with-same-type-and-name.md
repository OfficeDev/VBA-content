- The Windows resource file you are trying to use in your [project](vbe-glossary.md) contains two or more resources with the same type and name, or the file contains a resource that Visual Basic automatically creates.
    
    Use another resource file, or recreate the invalid resource file and delete one of the duplicate resources.
