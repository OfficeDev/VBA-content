# Add-In Manager Dialog Box


![Add-in manager](images/va5lxy1_ZA01201779.gif)



Allows you to register an [add-in](vbe-glossary.md), load or unload it, and set its load behavior. If you close only the visible portions of an add-in — by double-clicking its system menu or by clicking its Close button, for example — its forms disappear from the screen, but the add-in is still present in memory. The add-in object itself will always stay resident in memory until the add-in is disconnected through the  **Add-In Manager** dialog box.

To open the Add-In Manager, Add-In Manager from the  **Add-Ins** menu.
