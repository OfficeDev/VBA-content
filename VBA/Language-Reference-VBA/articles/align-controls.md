# Align controls




1. Select the controls to align.
    
2. Select the [dominant control](glossary-vba.md).
    
3. From the  **Format** menu, choose **Align**.
    
4. From the cascading menu, choose one of the following to align the specified part of each selected control with the same part of the dominant control:
    
    
    
      -  **Lefts** — to align the left edge.
    
  -  **Centers** — to align the center of each control. This means a vertical line drawn at the center of the dominant control would contain the center of every selected control.
    
  -  **Rights** — to align the right edge.
    
  -  **Tops** — to align the top.
    
  -  **Middles** — to align the center of each control. This means a horizontal line drawn at the center of the dominant control would also contain the center of every selected control.
    
  -  **Bottoms** — to align the bottom.
    
  -  **To Grid** — to align the upper left corner of each selected control with its nearest grid point. Note that this option is not based on the position of the dominant control.
    

    
    




 **Note**  Each command on the menu has a small picture that shows how the controls will be aligned.
