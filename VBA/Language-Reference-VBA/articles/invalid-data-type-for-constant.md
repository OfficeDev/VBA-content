# Invalid data type for constant

Not all types of data can be assigned to [constants](vbe-glossary.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to declare the type of a constant to be a [user-defined type](vbe-glossary.md), an object, or an [array](vbe-glossary.md).
    
    Remove the declaration or redeclare as a [variable](vbe-glossary.md).
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
