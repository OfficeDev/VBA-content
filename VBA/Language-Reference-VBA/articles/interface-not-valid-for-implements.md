# Interface not valid for Implements

Not all interfaces can be implemented in Visual Basic. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The interface contains some element that can't be supported by Visual Basic. For example, Visual Basic has no equivalent to the unsigned long integer type, Visual Basic can't designate a [procedure](vbe-glossary.md)[parameter](vbe-glossary.md) as "out-only." Although Visual Basic supports the use of the underscore character (_) in Visual Basic[identifiers](vbe-glossary.md), it can't implement an interface that uses underscore characters in the names of its members. 
    
    You can't implement the interface in Visual Basic.
