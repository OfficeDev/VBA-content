# Custom Help files

As an application developer, you can use a custom Help file to provide information about how to use your form application.

To create a custom Help file, use a product or tool that creates Windows Help files.

You can associate a specific topic in your custom Help file with each control in your application. When your application is running, the user can view your Help topic by selecting the control and pressing F1.
