# Could not execute specified program

When you create a native-code executable file, some extra programs must run. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- Memory or system resources were insufficient to run the code generator or linker. Close as many running applications as possible to free memory and other system resources.
    
- Visual Basic was installed incorrectly. Reinstall Visual Basic.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
