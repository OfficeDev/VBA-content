# Other applications are currently accessing an object in your program. Ending the program now could cause errors in those programs. End program at this time?

An [Automation object](vbe-glossary.md) in the Visual Basic program you are currently running is being accessed by at least one other application. Terminating your program could cause an error in the other application. Click **Yes** to quit your program or click **No** to continue it.
