# Name 'item' conflicts with existing module, project, or object library

This error has the following causes:



- You loaded a form, User Control, User Document, or Property Page that contains objects with conflicting names. This can occur if the file was edited outside of Visual Basic.
    
- This error can occur when you rename a form to the same name as the [project](vbe-glossary.md), another form, or a [module](vbe-glossary.md). It can also occur when you rename the project to the same name as a form or module.
