# Next without For

A  **Next** statement must have a preceding **For** statement that matches. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A  **Next** statement is used without a corresponding **For** statement. Check other control structures within the **For...Next** structure and verify that they are correctly matched. For example, an **If** without a matching **End If** inside the **For...Next** structure generates this error.
