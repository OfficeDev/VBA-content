# SHARE.EXE required

The program share.exe must be running when you start Visual Basic. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You didn't start share.exe before starting Visual Basic. Close your application, start share.exe, then restart your application. To avoid this problem in the future, place an invocation of share.exe in your autoexec.bat file so share.exe automatically starts when you turn on your machine.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
