# Expected procedure, not user-defined type

There is no [procedure](vbe-glossary.md) by this name in the current[scope](vbe-glossary.md), but there is a [user-defined type](vbe-glossary.md) by this name. You can call a procedure, but not a user-defined type. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a user-defined type is used as a procedure call. Check the spelling of the procedure name, and make sure the procedure you are trying to call isn't private to another [module](vbe-glossary.md).
