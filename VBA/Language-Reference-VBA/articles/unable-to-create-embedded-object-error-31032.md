# Unable to create embedded object (Error 31032)

The application that is creating the object can't create the object as specified in the  **SourceDoc** property.

For example, this error occurs if you try to embed a spreadsheet object and  **SourceDoc** specifies a spreadsheet that is too large to be loaded by the spreadsheet application.
