# Start Code Execution

One way to test your code is to run it and work with it as a user would.

 **To start code execution**




- Choose  **Run Sub/UserForm** (F5) from the **Run** menu.
    

If your application doesn't run, it may be because:


- A [syntax error](vbe-glossary.md) or some other error exists in your code.
    
- A [logic error](vbe-glossary.md) exists in your code, which may result in a[run-time error](vbe-glossary.md).
    

To get Help, click the  **Help** button or press F1 while the error message is displayed. Consider the suggestions provided to correct the error before you run your code again.
