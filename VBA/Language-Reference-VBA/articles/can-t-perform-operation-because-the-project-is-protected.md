# Can't perform operation because the project is protected

When a [project](vbe-glossary.md) is protected, certain actions are prohibited. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The project was inadvertently protected. Remove the protection, and then try the action again.
    
- The project was intentionally protected. Don't attempt the action until the protection is removed by the person that applied it in the first place.
