# Customize a Toolbox icon




1. Right-click the icon in the Toolbox.
    
2. From the shortcut menu, choose  **Customize**.
    
3. Do one of the following:
    
    
    
      - To change the ToolTip, enter the new text for the ToolTip.
    
  - To edit the icon, choose  **Edit Picture**. Then choose the color you want to use and choose the pixel in the image where you want to apply that color.
    
  - To assign a new bitmap, choose  **Load Picture**. Then identify the file that contains the bitmap you want to use as the icon. If you attempt to load a picture that is larger than an icon, an error occurs.
