# Copy Example Code from Help

Sometimes you may want to copy a useful example from Visual Basic Help. While many of the examples require more code to work correctly, some examples are useful to see how a particular [procedure](vbe-glossary.md) or control flow technique behaves.

 **To copy example code from Help to your application**




1. Use Help to display the topic for the language element whose example you want to use.
    
2. Click the Example link in the non-scrolling region near the top of the page. The code example is displayed.
    
3. Right-click and select the part of the code you want to copy to your application. On the Macintosh, choose  **Copy** from the **Edit** menu; a window appears in which you can select the code to copy.
    
4. Choose  **Copy** from the shortcut menu. On the Macintosh, press the **Copy** button.
    
5. Move the focus back to the  **Code** window and position the mouse pointer where you want the code example to be inserted.
    
6. Right-click again and choose  **Paste** to insert the code example into the **Code** window.
    
     **Tip**  You can also press CTRL+C to copy a selected example in a Help window. Press CTRL+V to paste the example into the  **Code** window.
