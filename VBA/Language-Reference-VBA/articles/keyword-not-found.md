# Keyword Not Found

The [keyword](vbe-glossary.md) you selected can't be found in Visual Basic Help. You may have misspelled the keyword, selected too much or too little text, or asked for help on a word that isn't a valid Visual Basic keyword.

The keyword you want help on may be contained within an [object library](vbe-glossary.md) that is not referenced. Make sure references are set to the appropriate object libraries for all objects used in your code.

The easiest way to get help on a specific keyword is to position the insertion point anywhere within the keyword and press F1. You don't have to select the keyword. In fact, if you select only a portion of the keyword, or more than a single word, Help won't find what you're looking for.

The  **Value** property topic is displayed when you press F1 with the insertion point between the "a" and the "l" in the **Value** keyword as shown in the following example.



```vb
Worksheets(1).Range ("A2").value=3.14159 

```

To use the built-in Help  **Search**, click **Microsoft Visual Basic Help** on the **Help** menu.
