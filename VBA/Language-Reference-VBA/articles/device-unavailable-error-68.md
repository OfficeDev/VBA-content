# Device unavailable (Error 68)

This error has the following causes and solutions:



- The device you are trying to access either is not online or doesn't exist. Check power to the device and any cables connecting your computer to the device. If you are trying to access a printer over a network, make sure there is a logical connection between your computer and the printer, for example, a connection associating LPT1 with the network printer ID.
    
- Your network connection may have been broken. Reconnect to the network and try the operation again.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
