# Split the Code Window

You can split the  **Code** window horizontally into two panes to view different code segments of a[module](vbe-glossary.md) at the same time. Each pane scrolls separately, both horizontally and vertically. The[Procedure](vbe-glossary.md) and[Object box](vbe-glossary.md) options refer to the pane that has the focus. Code changes are immediately reflected in both panes.

 **To split the Code window into panes**




- Drag the split bar at the top of the vertical scroll bar down from the upper-right corner of the  **Code** window.
    

 **To remove a split from the Code window**


- Double-click the split bar or drag it to the top or bottom of the  **Code** window.
