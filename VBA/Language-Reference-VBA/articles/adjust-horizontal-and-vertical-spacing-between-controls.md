# Adjust horizontal and vertical spacing between controls




1. Select the controls where you want to adjust spacing.
    
2. From the  **Format** menu, choose **Horizontal Spacing** or **Vertical Spacing**.
    
3. From the cascading menu, choose one of the following:
    
    
    
      -  **Make Equal** — to make all horizontal and vertical spaces between controls the same size. The amount of horizontal and vertical space will vary depending on the area available for displaying controls and the combined width of all controls.
    
  -  **Increase** — to increase the space between controls by one[grid block](glossary-vba.md).
    
  -  **Decrease** — to decrease the space between controls by one grid block.
    
  -  **Remove** — to remove the space between controls. The controls do not overlap, but are immediately adjacent to each other.
