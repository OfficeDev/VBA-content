# Execute a Specific Statement

While execution of your code is halted, you can control the execution sequence of [statements](vbe-glossary.md) within a[procedure](vbe-glossary.md). You can resume execution at a statement you choose without executing any intervening code.

 **To set the next statement to be executed**




1. In the  **Code** window, position the insertion point anywhere within the statement.
    
2. On the  **Debug** menu, click **Set Next Statement** (CTRL+F9). - or on Windows - Position the mouse pointer in the[margin indicator](vbe-glossary.md) next to the current execution point.
    
3. Drag the yellow arrow in the margin indicator to the statement you want to execute next.
    
     **Note**  You can only skip to statements within the same procedure.

    Used in combination with  **Step Into**, executing specific statements with the **Set Next Statement** command enables you to step through procedures one statement at a time, and to closely examine your code. It's also helpful for correcting or avoiding[run-time error](vbe-glossary.md) conditions.
