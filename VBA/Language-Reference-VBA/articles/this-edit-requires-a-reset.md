# This edit requires a Reset
In most cases, you can edit code and continue running the code from the point of the edit. This error has the following causes and solutions:


- You made a change to your code that requires you to restart the code from the initialization point. This might occur if you broke up the code in a procedure and the current execution line is no longer contained in the same procedural context as it was when execution was suspended.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
