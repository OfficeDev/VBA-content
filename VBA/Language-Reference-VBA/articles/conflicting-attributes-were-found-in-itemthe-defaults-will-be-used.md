# Conflicting attributes were found in 'item'. The defaults will be used

Some of the attribute statements in a form, User Control, Property Page, User Document, or Class Module conflict with the required settings for their type. For example, forms must always have the  **VB_PredeclaredId** attribute equal to **True**. This error can occur if the file was modified by an editor other than Visual Basic.
