# Specified library or project already referenced

The  **Add References** dialog box displays referenced libraries and[projects](vbe-glossary.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You chose the  **Browse** button in the **Add References** dialog box, then selected a[type library](vbe-glossary.md) or project that was already listed in the **Available References** section of the **Add References** dialog box.
    
    To make a project or type library part of your project, display the  **References** dialog box and make sure the type library or project name is checked.
