# End With without With

 **End With** must be matched with a preceding **With**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You used an  **End With** statement without a corresponding **With** statement. Check other control structures within the **With...End With** structure and verify that they are correctly matched. For example, an **If** without a matching **End If** inside the **With...End With** structure can cause this error.
