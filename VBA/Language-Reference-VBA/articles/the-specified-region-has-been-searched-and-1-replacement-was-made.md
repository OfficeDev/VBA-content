# The specified region has been searched and 1 replacement was made

When you click the  **Replace All** button in the **Replace** dialog box, this message specifies the total number of replacements. This condition has the following cause and effect:



- During the search and replace operation, only one instance of the specified text was found, and the replacement was made. You can specify the region to be covered: a selection, a [procedure](vbe-glossary.md), a [module](vbe-glossary.md), or a [project](vbe-glossary.md).
    
    If a region is selected, it is the default search region. If no region is selected, the current module is the default search region. To change the [scope](vbe-glossary.md) of a search, select a different option in the **Replace** dialog box.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
