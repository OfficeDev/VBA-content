# Remove <Item> Command (File Menu)

Permanently deletes the active [form](vbe-glossary.md) or[module](vbe-glossary.md) from the project. Not available when an item is not selected in the **Project** **Explorer**.

When removing a module from a project, make sure the remaining code doesn't refer to the removed item.

Before your item is deleted, you are asked if you want to export it as a file. If you click Yes in the message box, the  **Export** **File** dialog box opens. If you click No, the item is deleted.



 **Important**  You cannot undo this action.
