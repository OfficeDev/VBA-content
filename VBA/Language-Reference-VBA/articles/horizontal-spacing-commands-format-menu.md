 **Note**  The object with focus does not move but the other objects move around it.


 **Note**  If using the  **Horizontal** **Spacing** command does not produce the results you want, try to manually rearrange some of the objects and repeat the command. Also, try the using the **Vertical** **Spacing** command.
