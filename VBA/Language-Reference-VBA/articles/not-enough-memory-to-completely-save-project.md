# Not enough memory to completely save project

When a [project](vbe-glossary.md) is saved, extra information is usually saved to make it possible to load the project in a later version or on a different platform. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Memory available is insufficient to save information that will be necessary if you attempt to load the project in a later version of Visual Basic or on a different platform. If you plan to open the project in a later version of Visual Basic or on another platform, close some applications and try to save again.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
