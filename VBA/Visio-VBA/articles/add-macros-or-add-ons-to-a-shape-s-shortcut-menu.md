# Add Macros or Add-ons to a Shape's Shortcut Menu

1. Select the shape.
    
2. On the  [Developer](run-visio-in-developer-mode.md) tab, click **Show ShapeSheet**.
    
3. Click in an Action cell in an Actions section. If you don't see an Actions section, insert one by clicking  **Insert** in the **Sections** group on the **ShapeSheet Tools** tab and then selecting the **Actions** check box in the **Insert Section** dialog box.
    
4. In the  **Editing** group, click **Shape Actions**.
    
5. In the  **Action** dialog box, in the **Menu** box, enter the custom command you want to add to the shape's shortcut menu.
    
6. Click  **Run macro**, and then select the program you want to run from the  **Run macro** list. Click **OK**.
    
7. On the drawing page, right-click the shape, and then click the custom menu command on the shortcut menu to run the program.
    

 **Note**   You also can associate a macro or add-on with a shape by entering a formula that uses the RUNADDON function in any ShapeSheet cell.
