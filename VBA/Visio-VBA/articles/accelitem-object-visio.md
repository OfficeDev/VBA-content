# AccelItem Object (Visio)

Represents a single accelerator used by Visio.


## Remarks

An  **AccelItem** object consists of a key, modifiers to the key, and the Visio command or add-on that the accelerator executes when the user presses the accelerator. A key is any ASCII key code, and is not case-sensitive. The modifiers are ALT, CTRL, and SHIFT. Command identifiers are declared by the Visio type library and prefixed with **visCMD** .
