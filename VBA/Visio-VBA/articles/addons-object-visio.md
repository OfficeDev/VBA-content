# Addons Object (Visio)

Represents the set of installed add-ons known to an  **Application** object.


## Remarks

To retrieve an  **Addons** collection, use the **Addons** property of an **Application** object.

The default property of an  **Addons** collection is **Item** .

Installed add-ons are those Microsoft Visio finds in its  **Addons** or **StartUp** paths, those that were installed during the initial setup of Visio, those you have installed by using a Microsoft Windows Installer package, or those that other add-ons have dynamically installed by using the **Add** method of the **Addons** collection.
