# Run Macros or Add-ons from the Macros Dialog Box

1. In Visio, on the  **View** tab, click **Macros**.
    
2. In the  **Macros** dialog box, select the macro or add-on you want to run, and then click **Run**.
    

 **Note**   If you have more than one Visio drawing open and the macro you want to run does not appear in the **Macros** dialog box, make sure that in the **Macros in** list, you have selected the Visio document in which the macro is stored.
