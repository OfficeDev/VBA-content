# MenuItem.PaletteWidth Property (Visio)

Gets or sets the width of a palette in pixels. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **PaletteWidth**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **MenuItem** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

A palette, like a toolbar, is organized horizontally, and items wrap to a new row if there is not enough horizontal space available. By default, only the icons of the items are shown.
