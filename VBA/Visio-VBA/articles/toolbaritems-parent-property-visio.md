# ToolbarItems.Parent Property (Visio)

Determines the parent of an object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Parent**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ToolbarItems** object.


### Return Value

Toolbar


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

In general, an object's parent is the object that contains it.
