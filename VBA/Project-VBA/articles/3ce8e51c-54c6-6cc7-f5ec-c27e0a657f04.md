    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Report 1"
    
    If ActiveProject.Reports.IsPresent(reportName) Then
        ' To delete the active report, change to another view.
        ViewApplyEx Name:="&;Gantt Chart"
        
        ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Delete
    Else
        MsgBox Prompt:="No report name: " &; reportName, Title:="Report delete error"
    End If
End Sub
