# Protection.AllowFiltering Property (Excel)

Returns  **True** if the user is allowed to make use of an AutoFilter that was created before the sheet was protected. Read-only **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AllowFiltering**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Protection** object.


## Remarks

The  **AllowFiltering** property can be set by using the **[Protect](ed517a80-eea9-4268-5fbc-69c659beac0e.md)** method arguments.

```vb
Sub ProtectionOptions() 
 
 ActiveSheet.Unprotect 
 
 ' Unlock row 1. 
 Rows("1:1").Locked = False 
 
 ' Allow row 1 to be filtered on a protected worksheet. 
 If ActiveSheet.Protection.AllowFiltering = False Then 
 ActiveSheet.Protect AllowFiltering:=True 
 End If 
 
 MsgBox "Row 1 can be filtered on this protected worksheet." 
 
End Sub
```
