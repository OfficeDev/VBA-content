# Invalid Procedure Name Error


## Invalid Procedure Name error

You have either specified an invalid procedure name or did not include a procedure name when you attempted to create the procedure.

Valid macro names:


- Must begin with a letter.
    
- Cannot contain spaces or non-alphanumeric characters (ampersand (&;), asterisk (*), slash (/), and so on).
    
- Cannot contain periods. You may use a period (.) in a macro name only to explicitly define a procedure within a module. For example, if you type in the new macro name "my.test", you have created a new Module called "my" containing a Procedure named "test".
    
- Cannot exceed 80 characters.
    
- Cannot conflict with the reserved identifiers or keywords for a program, such as the word "print".
