# PivotField.LayoutPageBreak Property (Excel)

 **True** if a page break is inserted after each field. The default value is **False** . Read/write **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **LayoutPageBreak**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **PivotField** object.


## Remarks

Although you can set this property for any PivotTable field, the print option appears only if the specified field is a row field other than the innermost (lowest-level) row field. For non-OLAP data sources, the value of this property doesn't change when the field is rearranged or when it is added to or removed from the PivotTable report.


## Example

This example adds a page break after the state field in the first PivotTable report on the active worksheet.


```vb
With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1") _ 
 .PivotFields("state") 
 .LayoutPageBreak = True 
End With
```
