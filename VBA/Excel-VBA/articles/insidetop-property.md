# InsideTop Property

Returns the distance from the chart edge to the inside top edge of the plot area, in points. Read-only  **Double**.


## Remarks

The plot area used for this measurement doesn't include the axis labels. The  **Top** property for the plot area uses the bounding rectangle that includes the axis labels.
