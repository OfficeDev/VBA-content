# WebOptions.OrganizeInFolder Property (Excel)

 **True** if all supporting files, such as background textures and graphics, are organized in a separate folder when you save the specified document as a Web page. **False** if supporting files are saved in the same folder as the Web page. The default value is **True** . Read/write **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **OrganizeInFolder**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **WebOptions** object.


## Remarks

The new folder is created in the folder where you have saved the Web page, and is named after the document. If long file names are used, a suffix is added to the folder name. The  **[FolderSuffix](5361e4db-4f08-ab6c-1259-d04170879c99.md)** property returns the folder suffix for the language support you have selected or installed, or the default folder suffix.

If you save a document that was previously saved with the  **OrganizeInFolder** property set to a different value, Microsoft Excel automatically moves the supporting files into or out of the folder, as appropriate.

If you don't use long file names (that is, if the  **[UseLongFileNames](f30c4954-d691-3a36-1540-f280eea370d8.md)** property is set to **False** ), Microsoft Excel automatically saves any supporting files in a separate folder. The files cannot be saved in the same folder as the Web page.


## Example

This example specifies that all supporting files are saved in the same folder when the document is saved as a Web page.


```vb
Application.DefaultWebOptions.OrganizeInFolder = False
```
