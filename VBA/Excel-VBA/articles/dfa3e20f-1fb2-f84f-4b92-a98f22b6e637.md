This example uses the  **BeforeSave** event to verify that certain cells contain data before the workbook can be saved. The workbook cannot be saved until there is data in each of the following cells: D5, D7, D9, D11, D13, and D15.




```vb
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)
   'If the six specified cells do not contain data, then display a message box with an error
   'and cancel the attempt to save.
   If WorksheetFunction.CountA(Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("D5,D7,D9,D11,D13, D15")) < 6 Then
      MsgBox "Workbook will not be saved unless" &; vbCrLf &; _
      "All required fields have been filled in!"
      Cancel = True
   End If
End Sub
```
