# Create a Custom Dialog Box

Use the following procedure to create a custom dialog box:


1.  [Create a User Form](create-a-user-form.md)
    
    On the  **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, click **UserForm**.
    
2.  [Add Controls to a User Form](add-controls-to-a-user-form.md)
    
    Find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox** and drag the control onto the form.
    
3.  [Setting Control Properties](setting-control-properties.md)
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click  **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
4.  [Initializing Control Properties](initializing-control-properties.md)
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure before you show a form, or you can add code to the Initialize event of the form.
    
5.  [Control and Dialog Box Events](control-and-dialog-box-events.md)
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a  **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
    
6.  [Displaying a Custom Dialog Box](displaying-a-custom-dialog-box.md)
    
    Use the  **Show** method to display a UserForm.
    
7.  [Using Control Values While Code Is Running](using-control-values-while-code-is-running.md)
    
    Some properties can be set at run time. Changes made to the dialog box by the user are lost when the dialog box is closed.
