# Application.Windows Property (Project)

Gets a  **[Windows](6fc70ece-0257-5565-907b-e0e7a6770980.md)** collection representing the open windows in the application. Read-only **Object**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Windows**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


## Remarks

The  **Windows** property duplicates the **Windows2** property, except that it returns a **Windows** collection rather than a **Windows2** collection. The **[Windows2](038d051c-769d-3a14-c884-7b4b669d3cc8.md)** property and **[Windows2](a58383c6-12c7-81b3-10e8-81ba9180404c.md)** collection object are recommended for all new development both in VBA and for external applications developed with the .NET Framework. The **Windows** property and **Windows** collection are maintained for backward compatibility with existing applications.


## Example

The following example cascades all the open windows.


```vb
Sub CascadeWindows() 
 Dim I As Integer 
 
 ActiveWindow.WindowState = pjNormal ' Restore the window. 
 
 With Application.Windows 
 For I = 1 To .Count 
 .Item(I).Activate 
 .Item(I).Top = (I - 1) * 15 
 .Item(I).Left = (I - 1) * 15 
 Next I 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
