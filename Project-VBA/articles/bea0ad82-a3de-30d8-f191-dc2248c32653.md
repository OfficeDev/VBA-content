# TimeScaleValue Object (Project)

Represents a timescaled data item. The  **TimeScaleValue** object is a member of the **[TimeScaleValues](d94a0346-7cf5-b734-b32d-430fba980824.md)** collection.


## Examples

 **Using the TimeScaleValue Object**

Use  **TimeScaleValues** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the index number of the timescaled data item, to return a single **TimeScaleValue** object. The following example displays the number of hours of work per day for a resource during the first full week in October 2012.




```vb
Dim TSV As TimeScaleValues, HowMany As Long
Dim HoursPerDay As String

Set TSV = ActiveCell.Resource.TimeScaleData("10/1/2012", "10/5/2012", TimescaleUnit:=pjTimescaleDays)

For HowMany = 1 To TSV.Count
    HoursPerDay = HoursPerDay &; TSV(HowMany).StartDate &; " - " &; _
        TSV(HowMany).EndDate &; ", " &; TSV(HowMany) / 60 &; vbCrLf
Next HowMany

MsgBox HoursPerDay
```

 **Using the TimeScaleValues Collection**

Use the  **[TimeScaleData](51649bc3-8224-15cd-dc9b-af37a1cc4d8b.md)** method to return a **TimeScaleValues** collection. The following example returns a **TimeScaleValues** collection for the amount of work done by the resource in the active cell between the specified dates, split into week-long portions.




```vb
ActiveCell.Resource.TimeScaleData("10/1/2012", "10/31/2012")
```

Use the  **[Add](083ef154-31ce-55ec-793a-0627c1eff211.md)** method to add a **TimeScaleValue** object to the **TimeScaleValues** collection. The following example adds 8 hours of work to Tuesday of that week.




```vb
Dim TSV As TimeScaleValues

Set TSV = ActiveCell.Resource.TimeScaleData("10/1/2012", "10/5/2012", TimescaleUnit:=pjTimescaleDays)
TSV.Add 480, 2
```
