# ShapeRange.RerouteConnections Method (Project)
The  **RerouteConnections** method is not implemented in Project.

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RerouteConnections**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ShapeRange** object.


### Return value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

In general for applications that implement Office Art, the  **RerouteConnections** method changes the routing of a connector to the shortest path between the shapes it connects. Project does not support the connect and disconnect methods of the **ConnectorFormat** object, and so it does not support **RerouteConnections**. For more information, see the  ** [ConnectorFormat](7193b3aa-2e3f-d349-c398-d30e2878ceaa.md)** property.
