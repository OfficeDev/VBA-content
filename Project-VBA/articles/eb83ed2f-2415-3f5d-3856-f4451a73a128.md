# Resource Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents a resource. The  **Resource** object is a member of the ** [Resources](84f8357a-358b-f2ae-e164-65c0c5abd383.md)** collection.
 **Using the Resource Object**
Use  **Resources**( _Index_), where  _Index_ is the resource index number or resource name, to return a single **Resource** object. The following example lists the names of all resources in the active project.
 **Using the Resources Collection**
Use the  ** [Resources](40744aba-2b61-2b45-133a-f1dd9c7d6add.md)** property to return a **Resources** collection. The following example generates the same list as the previous example, but does so by setting an object reference to `ActiveProject.Resources`and then by using  `R` where `ActiveProject.Resources` is used.
Use the  ** [Add](4fb69f50-4ba6-89a4-f586-3df268ae7fd5.md)** method to add a **Resource** object to the **Resources** collection. The following example adds a new resource named Matilda to the active project.
