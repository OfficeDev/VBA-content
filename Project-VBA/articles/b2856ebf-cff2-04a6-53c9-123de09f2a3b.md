# OverAllocatedAssignments Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a collection of  ** [Assignment](bfb9a505-7818-0a86-9d4b-f19a0ff465d3.md)** objects where the resource is overallocated.

## Remarks

Use the  ** [Item](5939e712-0abd-cb4b-31fe-ad2fa61835d6.md)** property to get a single **Assignment** object from the **OverAllocatedAssignments** collection.


## Example

The following example finds assignments where the resource is overallocated. When the overPeak argument is  **False**, the overallocation is not greater than the maximum resource time available (100%). If you set overPeak to  **True**, the example finds overallocated assignments that exceed maximum resource time available, such as 150%.


```
Sub FindOverallocatedAssignments()  
    Dim t As Task  
    Dim a As Assignment  
    Dim overAlloc As OverAllocatedAssignments  
    Dim numOver As Long  
    Dim overPeak As Boolean  
  
    overPeak = False  
  
    For Each t In ActiveProject.Tasks  
        If t.Overallocated Then  
            Set overAlloc = t.StartDriver.OverAllocatedAssignments(overPeak)  
            numOver = overAlloc.Count  
            totalNumOver = overAlloc.TotalDetectedCount  
  
            For Each a In overAlloc  
                Debug.Print "Resource: " &amp; a.Resource.Name &amp; " is overallocated on task: " &amp; t.Name  
                Debug.Print vbTab &amp; "Number of overallocated assignments: " &amp; numOver  
            Next a  
        End If  
    Next t  
End Sub
```
