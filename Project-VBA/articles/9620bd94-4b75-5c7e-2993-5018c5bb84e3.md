# Project.CheckIn Method (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Checks in the working copy of the project from a local computer to the SharePoint document library, and sets the local project to read-only so that it cannot be edited locally.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **CheckIn**( **_SaveChanges_**,  **_Comment_**,  **_MakePublic_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Project** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SaveChanges|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** saves changes and checks in the document. **False** returns the document to a checked-in status without saving revisions.|
|Comment|Optional| **String**|Comments for the revision of the project being checked in (applies only if SaveChanges equals  **True**).|
|MakePublic|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** allows the user to publish the project after it has been checked in. This submits the project for the approval process, which can eventually result in a version of the project being published to users with read-only rights to the project (applies only if SaveChanges equals **True**).|

## Remarks

 The **CheckIn** method also closes the project after it is checked in.
