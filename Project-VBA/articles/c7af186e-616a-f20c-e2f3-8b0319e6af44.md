### Example

Sub DuplicateShapeRange()
    Dim theReport As Report
    Dim shp1 As shape
    Dim shp2 As shape
    Dim shp3 As shape
    Dim reportName As String
    Dim sRange1 As ShapeRange
    Dim sRange2 As ShapeRange
    
    reportName = "Apply Report"
    
    Set theReport = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName)
    Set shp1 = theReport.Shapes(1)
    Set shp2 = theReport.Shapes(2)
    Set shp3 = theReport.Shapes(3)
