## Example

The following example uses the report created by the code example in the  ** [Shape.Apply](8d7a29f0-6a69-f643-6726-0c85247fb957.md)** method. The example duplicates a shape, and then rotates, horizontally flips, and selects the new shape. The horizontal offset and vertical offset of the new shape are both 12 points.


```
Sub DuplicateShape()
    Dim theReport As Report
    Dim shp1 As shape
    Dim duplicatedShape As shape
    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Apply Report"
    
    Set theReport = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName)
    Set shp1 = theReport.Shapes(1)
    
    Set duplicatedShape = shp1.Duplicate
    
    pos1 = shp1.left
    pos2 = duplicatedShape.left
    Debug.Print "Horizontal offset: " &amp; CStr(pos2 - pos1)
    
    pos1 = shp1.top
    pos2 = duplicatedShape.top
    Debug.Print "Vertical offset: " &amp; CStr(pos2 - pos1)
   
    duplicatedShape.Rotation = 30
    duplicatedShape.Flip msoFlipHorizontal
