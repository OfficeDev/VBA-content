# ResourceGroups2 Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents all of the resource-based group definitions, where group hierarchy can be maintained.  **ResourceGroups2** is a collection of ** [Group2](a7a61fa4-e752-006e-a47e-03987b04f01c.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the ResourceGroups2 Collection**

Use the  ** [ResourceGroups2](2edec49b-2deb-b758-5d27-808ee391d994.md)** property to return a **ResourceGroups2** collection. The following example lists the names of all the resource groups in the active project.




```
Dim rg2 As Group2  
Dim rGroups2 As String  
  
For Each rg2 in ActiveProject.ResourceGroups2  
    rGroups2 = rGroups2 &amp; rg2.Name &amp; vbCrLf  
Next rg2  
  
MsgBox rGroups2
```

Use the  ** [Add](28bf0ab1-de03-1519-0817-8e2bc4417940.md)** method to add a **Group2** object to the **ResourceGroups2** collection. The following example creates a new group that groups resources by their standard rate and then modifies the criterion so that the resources are sorted in descending order.




```
ActiveProject.ResourceGroups2.Add "Resources by Rate", "Standard Rate"  
ActiveProject.ResourceGroups2("Resources by Rate").GroupCriteria(1).Ascending = False
```
