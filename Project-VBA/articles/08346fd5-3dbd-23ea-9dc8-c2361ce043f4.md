# TaskGroups2 Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents all the task-based group definitions, where group hierarchy can be maintained.  **TaskGroups2** is a collection of ** [Group2](a7a61fa4-e752-006e-a47e-03987b04f01c.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the TaskGroups2 Collection**

Use the  ** [TaskGroups2](e457ea72-be4e-4480-718d-548d8339b8b6.md)** property to return a **TaskGroups2** collection. The following example lists the names of all the task groups in the active project.




```
Dim tg2 As Group2
Dim tGroups2 As String

For Each tg2 in ActiveProject.TaskGroups2  
    tGroups2 = tGroups2 &amp; tg2.Name &amp; vbCrLf  
Next tg2  

MsgBox tGroups2
```

Use the  ** [Add](2f7a39a4-527f-1355-f3d0-4d5e674bf00c.md)** method to add a **Group2** object to the **TaskGroups2** collection. The following example creates a new group that groups tasks by whether they are overallocated and then modifies the criterion so that overallocated tasks are sorted in descending order.




```
ActiveProject.TaskGroups2.Add "Overallocated Tasks", "Overallocated"
ActiveProject.TaskGroups2("Overallocated Tasks").GroupCriteria(1).Ascending = False
```
