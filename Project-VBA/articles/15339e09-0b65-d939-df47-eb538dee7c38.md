## Syntax

 _expression_. **UseOMIDs**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks

Object Matching Identifier (OMID) fields are added to objects that can be shared across multilanguage versions. OMIDs are supported for  **Calendar**,  **Filter**,  **Group**,  **Table**, and  **View** objects. OMIDs are not supported for **Form** and **Report** objects. Project uses OMIDs to match similar elements in a multilanguage installation and avoid multiple language elements in the UI.
