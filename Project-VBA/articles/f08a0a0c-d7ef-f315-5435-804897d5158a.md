# CostRateTables Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 Contains a collection of ** [CostRateTable](ca514e06-3542-00f1-5221-a609378d2392.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the CostRateTables Collection**

Use the  ** [CostRateTables](604d89ee-a16e-812e-0459-b93ed096340e.md)** property to return a **CostRateTables** collection. The following example lists the standard pay rates for all the cost rate tables of the resource in the active cell.




```
Dim CRT As CostRateTable, PR As PayRate 

Dim Rates As String 

 

For Each CRT In ActiveCell.Resource.CostRateTables 

 For Each PR In CRT.PayRates 

 Rates = Rates &amp; "CostRateTable " &amp; CRT.Name &amp; ": " &amp; PR.StandardRate &amp; vbCrLf 

 Next PR 

Next CRT 

 

MsgBox Rates
```
