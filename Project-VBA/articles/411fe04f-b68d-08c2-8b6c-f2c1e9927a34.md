# Day Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Represents a day in a month. The  **Day** object is a member of the ** [Days](ac9cc007-a318-c9a8-2e6c-c4834a52d5c2.md)** collection.

## Example

 **Using the Day Object**

Use  **Days** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the day index number or ** [PjWeekday](02572463-5e6d-e62e-6776-2e24359980aa.md)** constant, to return a single **Day** object. The following example counts the number of working days in the month of September 2008 for each selected resource.




```
Dim R As Resource, D As Integer, WorkingDays As Integer 
 
For Each R In ActiveSelection.Resources() 
    WorkingDays = 0 
    With R.Calendar.Years(2008).Months(pjSeptember) 
        For D = 1 To .Days.Count 
            If .Days(D).Working = True Then 
                WorkingDays = WorkingDays + 1 
            End If 
        Next D 
    End With 
    MsgBox "There are " &amp; WorkingDays &amp; " working days in " _ 
        &amp; R.Name &amp; "'s calendar." 
Next R
```

 **Using the Days Collection**

Use the  ** [Days](86572272-1a5f-2c86-2111-e41f39f4c1e6.md)** property to return a **Days** collection. The following example counts the number of working days in the month of September 2008.




```
ActiveProject.Calendar.Years(2008).Months(pjSeptember).Days.Count
```
