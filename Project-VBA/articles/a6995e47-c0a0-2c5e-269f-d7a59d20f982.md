# Pane Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents a pane of a window. (There is no collection for  **Pane** objects.) You can access the **Pane** object through the ** [ActivePane](25cb8cf3-c313-304a-f69e-6797b04dcac8.md)**,  ** [TopPane](0390e494-7895-9cec-fed7-3cbc5c94506b.md)**, and  ** [BottomPane](5b165c3d-6316-8e9c-782c-c350fb768cda.md)** properties of a **Window** object.
 **Using the Pane Object**
Use a property such as the  ** [BottomPane](5b165c3d-6316-8e9c-782c-c350fb768cda.md)** property to return a **Pane** object. The following example checks for the existence of a pane at the bottom of the window and then creates, and applies, a new two-pane view.
