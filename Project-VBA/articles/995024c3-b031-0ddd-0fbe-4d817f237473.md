|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|tsk|Required| **Task**|The task whose field is being changed.|
|Field|Required| **Long**|The field being changed. If more than one field is changed by the user, the event is fired for each field changed. Can be one of the  ** [PjField](f0df0929-921c-1f33-ab42-192efdaeb64d.md)** constants.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Project events do not occur when the project is embedded in another document or application.

The  **ProjectBeforeTaskChange** event doesn't occur when timescaled data changes, when constraint data in the Task Details Form changes, when a task is split by manipulating its task bar on the Gantt Chart, when changes are made to outline level or outline number, when a baseline is saved, when a baseline is cleared, when an entire task row is pasted, during resource pool operations, when inserting or removing a subproject, or when changes have been made using a custom form. For more information and sample code for creating and testing an event handler, see [Using Events with Application and Project Objects](64a18885-f203-c298-db11-f9e8e75bb7b6.md).


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example informs the user when the duration of a task increases and by how much. This example requires a new class module and additional code for it to have an effect.


```
Private Sub App_ProjectBeforeTaskChange(ByVal tsk As Task, ByVal Field As PjField, _ 
    ByVal NewVal As Variant, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
    Dim TaskDuration As Long 
 
    TaskDuration = Val(NewVal) * 480 ' Convert days to minutes 
 
    If Field = pjTaskDuration And TaskDuration > tsk.Duration Then 
        If (TaskDuration - tsk.Duration) \ 480 < 1 Then 
            MsgBox "The task " &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; tsk.Name &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; " is now " &amp; _ 
                (TaskDuration - tsk.Duration) / 480 &amp; (TaskDuration - tsk.Duration) \ 480 &amp; _ 
                " day(s) longer." 
        Else 
            MsgBox "The task " &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; tsk.Name &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; " is now " &amp; _ 
               (TaskDuration - tsk.Duration) / 480 &amp; " day(s) longer." 
        End If 
    End If 
End Sub
```
