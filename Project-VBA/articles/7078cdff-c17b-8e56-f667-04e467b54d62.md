## Syntax

 _expression_. **CellColorEx**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **GroupCriterion2** object.


## Remarks

RGB colors can be expressed in decimal or hexadecimal values. In Project, red is the last byte of a hexadecimal value. For example, if the value of CellColorEx is 65535, the color is blue (&amp;HFF0000). 

The valid range for a normal RGB color is 0 to 16,777,215 (&amp;HFFFFFF&amp;). Each color setting (property or argument) is a 4-byte integer. The high byte of a number in this range equals 0. The lower 3 bytes, from least to most significant byte, determine the amount of red, green, and blue, respectively. The red, green, and blue components are each represented by a number between 0 and 255 (&amp;HFF).
