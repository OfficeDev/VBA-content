 _expression_. **Vertices**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.

You can use the array returned by the  **Vertices** property as an argument for the [AddCurve](16ea0f55-268a-b224-cc94-3d7e74de6265.md) method or the [AddPolyLine](c61cbaf3-b687-b137-e4a2-8f9061dfc0f0.md) method.

For an array of vertices named  `vertArray`, the following table shows how the  **Vertices** property associates values in the array with the coordinates of vertices in a triangle.



|**Element in the array**|**Value of the element (in points)**|
|:-----|:-----|
| `vertArray(1, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the first vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(1, 2)`|The vertical distance from the first vertex to the top of the document.|
| `vertArray(2, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the second vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(2, 2)`|The vertical distance from the second vertex to the top of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the third vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 2)`|The vertical distance from the third vertex to the top of the document.|
