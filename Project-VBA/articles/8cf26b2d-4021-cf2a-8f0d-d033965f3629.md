 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.

If the active view is not a report, the  **SelectTable** method displays a dialog box with run-time error 1100, "The method is not available in this situation." If no item in a report is selected, or if an item in another kind of shape (not a table) is selected, Project shows run-time error -2147417848, "Automation error. The object invoked has disconnected from its clients."
