 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents an account profile in Project Professional. The  **Profile** object is a member of the ** [Profiles](0e25c828-6482-4d68-f482-ae72c919f338.md)** collection.
If the second account profile is a Project Server account, the following statement returns the value 1, which is the value of the  **pjServerProfile** constant in the ** [PjProfileType](37b5faa0-bd06-09e7-7185-44444daec348.md)** enumeration.

## Remarks

The  **Project Server Accounts** dialog box shows the number and order of profiles. Use `Profiles.Count` to programmatically determine the number of account profiles defined in Project Professional.
