# TaskDependencies Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains a collection of  ** [TaskDependency](05d759fb-0203-761e-10f3-65b07d233f4d.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the TaskDependency Object**

Use  **TaskDependencies** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the dependency index, to return a single **TaskDependency** object. The following example adds 1.5 days of lag to the link between the specified task and the predecessor specified in its first task dependency.




```
ActiveProject.Tasks("Draft Initial Business Case").TaskDependencies(1).Lag = "1.5d"
```

 **Using the TaskDependencies Collection**

Use the  ** [TaskDependencies](9c02fe5f-cb9e-a10e-bf9a-66b7600f8c64.md)** property to return a **TaskDependencies** collection. The following example examines each predecessor for the specified task and displays a message for each that has a priority of "High" or better.




```
Dim TaskDep As TaskDependency 

 

For Each TaskDep In ActiveProject.Tasks("Write Requirements Brief").TaskDependencies 

 If TaskDep.From.Priority > 500 Then 

 MsgBox "Task #" &amp; TaskDep.From.ID &amp; " (" &amp; TaskDep.From.Name &amp; ") " &amp; _ 

 "has a priority higher than medium." 

 End If 

Next TaskDep
```

Use the  ** [Add](37e67ab2-ca7b-26c2-50e7-8a933b746489.md)** method to add a **TaskDependency** object to the **TaskDependencies** collection. The following example links "Preliminary Research &amp; Approval" as a predecessor to "Draft Initial Business Case" in a finish-to-start relationship.




```
ActiveProject.Tasks("Draft Initial Business Case").TaskDependencies.Add ActiveProject.Tasks("Preliminary Research &amp; Approval"), pjFinishToStart
```
