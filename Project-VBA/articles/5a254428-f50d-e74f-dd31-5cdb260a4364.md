# Projects Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains a collection of ** [Project](855c1ad9-0e84-f274-9e0e-2424e7cab447.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the Project Object**

Use  **Projects**(Index), where Index is the project index number or project name, to return a single  **Project** object. The following example switches among all the open projects, memorizes the full name of each, and then displays the results.




```
Dim Temp As Long, Names As String 

 

For Temp = 1 To Projects.Count 

 Projects(Temp).Activate 

 Names = Names &amp; Projects(Temp).FullName &amp; vbCrLf 

Next Temp 

 

MsgBox Names
```

 **Using the Projects Collection**

Use the  ** [Projects](792b7334-a424-abe1-287e-285d3ab362c7.md)** property to return a **Projects** collection. The following example counts the number of open projects.




```
Application.Projects.Count
```

Because the  **Projects** collection is a top-level object, the following example is functionally identical to the preceding one.




```
Projects.Count
```

Use the  ** [Add](51629c33-1521-bfee-edf7-bed792d393c1.md)** method to add a **Project** object to the **Projects** collection. The following example creates a new project without prompting for project information.




```
Projects.Add False
```
