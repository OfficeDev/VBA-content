# Series Object (Project)
Represents a collection of related data that makes a row or a column in a chart.

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


## Remarks

A  **Series** object is a member of the ** [SeriesCollection](2065e328-f82c-266f-e34c-fa99100c862e.md)** collection, which includes all of the data series in the chart. The name of the series is often displayed in the chart legend.


## Example

The following example prints the series names, X (horizontal) values, and Y (vertical) values for a collection of data series on a chart.


```
Sub TestChartSeries()
    Dim reportName As String
    Dim theReportIndex As Integer
    Dim theChart As Chart
    Dim seriesCollec As SeriesCollection
    Dim chartSeries As Series
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer
        
    reportName = "Simple scalar chart"
    theReportIndex = -1
        
    If (ActiveProject.Reports.IsPresent(reportName)) Then
        ' Make the report active.
        theReportIndex = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Index
        ActiveProject.Reports(theReportIndex).Apply
        
        Set theChart = ActiveProject.Reports(theReportIndex).Shapes(1).Chart
        Set seriesCollec = theChart.SeriesCollection()
        
        For i = 1 To seriesCollec.Count
            Set chartSeries = seriesCollec(i)
        
            If (IsEmpty(chartSeries.Name)) Then
                Debug.Print "Series " &amp; i &amp; " name is an empty string."
            Else
                Debug.Print "Series " &amp; i &amp; ": " &amp; chartSeries.Name
            End If
            
            For j = 1 To seriesCollec.Count
                Debug.Print vbTab &amp; "X, Y values(" &amp; j &amp; "): " &amp; chartSeries.XValues(j) _
                    &amp; ", " &amp; chartSeries.Values(j); ""
            Next j
        Next i
    End If
End Sub
```

The following sample output is from a chart such as the example in the  [Chart](810d4ec1-69d2-c432-b9da-57042b783b85.md) object documentation.




```
Series 1: Actual Work
    X, Y values(1): T1, 16
    X, Y values(2): T2 - new, 32
    X, Y values(3): T3, 7
Series 2: Remaining Work
    X, Y values(1): T1, 0
    X, Y values(2): T2 - new, 16
    X, Y values(3): T3, 17
Series 3: Work
    X, Y values(1): T1, 16
    X, Y values(2): T2 - new, 48
    X, Y values(3): T3, 24
