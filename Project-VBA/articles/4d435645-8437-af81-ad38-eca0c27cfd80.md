 Set Task = ActiveProject.Tasks(ID) 
 Set SuccTasks = Task.SuccessorTasks 
 Successors = Task.WBSSuccessors 
 Count = 1

 List = List &amp; SuccTasks(Count).Name &amp; ": " &amp; Mid$(Successors, 1, InStr(Successors, ListSeparator) - 1) &amp; vbCrLf 
 Successors = Right$(Successors, Len(Successors) - InStr(Successors, ListSeparator))
