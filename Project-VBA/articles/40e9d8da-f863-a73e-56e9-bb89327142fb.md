## Remarks

You can trap project-level events from outside VBA.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

 The following example shows how the **ProjectTaskNew** event can trap project-level events. In this case, the **App_ProjectTaskNew** event handler sets the global **ProjTaskNew** variable that the **Change** event handler uses. You can use similar code with the ** [ProjectResourceNew](9b030fbc-5cca-df10-f7a3-613d7ad70dc7.md)** and ** [ProjectAssignmentNew](dcb4acc6-a113-1e93-5f08-e9e68b902b96.md)** events.


1. Create a class module named  **EventClassModule**, and then insert the following code:
    
  ```
  Option Explicit 
Option Base 1 
 
Public WithEvents App As Application 
Public WithEvents Proj As Project 
 
Dim NewTaskIDs() As Integer 
Dim NumNewTasks As Integer 
 
Dim ProjTaskNew As Boolean 
 
Private Sub App_ProjectTaskNew(ByVal pj As Project, ByVal ID As Long) 
    NumNewTasks = NumNewTasks + 1 
 
    If ProjTaskNew Then 
        ReDim Preserve NewTaskIDs(NumNewTasks) As Integer 
    Else 
        ReDim NewTaskIDs(NumNewTasks) As Integer 
    End If 
 
    NewTaskIDs(NumNewTasks) = ID 
 
    ProjTaskNew = True 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub Proj_Change(ByVal pj As Project) 
    Dim NewTaskID As Variant 
 
    If ProjTaskNew Then 
        For Each NewTaskID In NewTaskIDs 
            MsgBox "New Task Name: " &amp; ActiveProject.Tasks.UniqueID(NewTaskID).Name 
        Next NewTaskID 
 
        NumNewTasks = 0 
 
        ProjTaskNew = False 
    End If 
End Sub 

  ```


    
    
2. In a separate module, insert the following code:
    
  ```
  Option Explicit 
 
Dim X As New EventClassModule 
 
Sub Initialize_App() 
    Set X.App = MSProject.Application 
    Set X.Proj = Application.ActiveProject 
End Sub
  ```


    
    
3. Run the  **Initialize_App** procedure to start listening to the events.
    
4. Create a task. The event handler shows a message box every time a new task is added.
