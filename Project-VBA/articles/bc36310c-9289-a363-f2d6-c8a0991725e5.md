# SplitParts Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains a collection of  ** [SplitPart](7eb80010-7b5a-3833-a5c5-b02d0c0bea5c.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the SplitParts Collection Object**

Use  **SplitParts** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the index number of the task index number, to return a single **SplitPart** object. The following example lists the start and finish times of each task portion of the task in the active cell.




```
Dim Part As Long, Portions As String 

 

For Part = 1 To ActiveCell.Task.SplitParts.Count 

 With ActiveCell.Task 

 Portions = Portions &amp; "Task portion " &amp; Part &amp; ": Start on " &amp; _ 

 .SplitParts(Part).Start &amp; ", Finish on " &amp; _ 

 .SplitParts(Part).Finish &amp; vbCrLf 

 End With 

Next Part 

 

MsgBox Portions
```

 **Using the SplitParts Collection**

Use the  ** [SplitParts](e4c62dce-4ee0-aff3-3248-f6b5b04b0c2d.md)** property to return a **SplitParts** collection. The following example returns the number of task portions for each task in the active project.




```
Dim T As Task 

 

For Each T In ActiveProject.Tasks 

 If Not (T Is Nothing) Then 

 MsgBox T.Name &amp; ": " &amp; T.SplitParts.Count 

 End If 

 

Next T
```

Use the  ** [Split](847c5cfd-a10f-ea6a-aa49-2e2e88d1840e.md)** method ( **Task** object) to add a **SplitPart** object to the **SplitParts** collection. (The **Split** method creates a split in a task.) The following example creates a split in the task from Wednesday to Monday.




```
ActiveCell.Task.Split "10/2/02", "10/7/02"
```
