# TaskDependency Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents the link type and link lag information between two tasks. The  **TaskDependency** object is a member of the ** [TaskDependencies](60bda111-998f-1cc2-0b18-b419041767f5.md)** collection.
 **Using the TaskDependency Object**
Use  **TaskDependencies**( _Index_), where  _Index_ is the dependency index, to return a single **TaskDependency** object. The following example adds 1.5 days of lag to the link between the specified task and the predecessor specified in its first task dependency.
 **Using the TaskDependencies Collection**
Use the  ** [TaskDependencies](9c02fe5f-cb9e-a10e-bf9a-66b7600f8c64.md)** property to return a **TaskDependencies** collection. The following example examines each predecessor for the specified task and displays a message for each that has a priority of "High" or better.
Use the  ** [Add](37e67ab2-ca7b-26c2-50e7-8a933b746489.md)** method to add a **TaskDependency** object to the **TaskDependencies** collection. The following example links "Preliminary Research &amp; Approval" as a predecessor to "Draft Initial Business Case" in a finish-to-start relationship.
