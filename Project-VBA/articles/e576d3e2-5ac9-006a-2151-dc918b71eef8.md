```
 
          Sub CreateAndApplyHighestPriorityFilter() 
 
          Dim TaskFilter As Variant  ' Index for For Each loop. 
          Dim Found As Boolean    ' Whether or not the filter exists. 
 
          Found = False   ' Assume the filter does not exist. 
 
          ' Look for filter. 
          For Each TaskFilter In ActiveProject.TaskFilterList 
          If TaskFilter = "Highest Priority" Then 
          Found = True 
          Exit For 
          End If 
          Next TaskFilter 
 
          ' If filter doesn't exist, create it. 
          If Not Found Then FilterEdit Name:="Highest Priority", _ 
          Create:=True, TaskFilter:=True, FieldName:="Priority", _ 
          Test:="equals", Value:="Highest"
