 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015


Represents a work shift for a day, month, period, weekday, or year. There is no collection for  **Shift** objects. The **Shift** object can be accessed through the **Shift _n_** properties of appropriate objects, such as the **Day**. ** [Shift1](f57a5d81-85a6-0464-943a-0556b9521755.md)** property.
 **Using the Shift Object**
Use the  **Shift _n_** property to return a **Shift** object. The following example sets every Friday as a half-day by setting the start and finish times for the first shift and clearing the values of the second and third shifts.
