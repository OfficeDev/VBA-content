# Task.GroupBySummary Property (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 [Syntax](#sectionSection0)
 [Remarks](#sectionSection1)
 [Example](#sectionSection2)


 **True** if the selected item in a task view is in a group summary row; otherwise, **false**. Read-only  **Boolean**.


## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **GroupBySummary**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Task** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When you apply a  **Group by** command to a task view, the group summary rows show the group definition in the **Task Name** column. If a selected cell is in a group summary row, the **GroupBySummary** property is **True**.

The  **GroupBySummary** property is accessible through the `ActiveCell.Task` property, not through `ActiveProject.Tasks(x)`.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example applies the Duration grouping to the Gantt Chart view, and then selects the first cell in each row of the view and tests whether the row is a group summary. The process continues until the row is empty, and then shows a message box with the test results for each row.


```
Sub ShowGroupByItems() 
 Dim isValid As Boolean 
 Dim tsk As Task 
 Dim rowType As String 
 Dim msg As String 
 
 isValid = True 
 msg = "" 
 
 ActiveProject.Views("Gantt Chart").Apply 
 GroupApply Name:="Duration" 
 Application.SelectBeginning 
 
 ' When a cell in an empty row is selected, accessing the ActiveCell.Task 
 ' property results in error 1004. 
 On Error Resume Next 
 
 ' Loop until a cell in an empty row is selected. 
 While isValid 
 Set tsk = ActiveCell.Task 
 
 If Err.Number > 0 Then 
 isValid = False 
 Debug.Print Err.Number 
 Err.Number = 0 
 Else 
 If tsk.GroupBySummary Then 
 rowType = "' is a group-by summary row." 
 Else 
 rowType = "' is a task row." 
 End If 
 
 msg = msg &amp; "Task name: '" &amp; tsk.Name &amp; rowType &amp; vbCrLf 
 SelectCellDown 
 End If 
 Wend 
 
 MsgBox msg, vbInformation, "GroupBy Summary for Tasks" 
 
End Sub
```
