Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the shape retains its original proportions when you resize it; that is, whether the aspect ratio of the shape is locked. Read-write  ** [MsoTriState](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff860737%28v=office.15%29)**

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **LockAspectRatio**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **LockAspectRatio** value is **msoTrue** if the shape retains its original proportions when it is resized. If you can change the height and width of the shape independently, the value is **msoFalse**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example creates two triangles of the same size. The left triangle has the aspect ratio unlocked, and the right triangle has the aspect ratio locked. Figure 1 shows the result when each triangle is resized by the same amount.


```
Sub ResizeTriangles()
    Dim shapeReport As Report
    Dim reportName As String
    Dim triangle1 As shape
    Dim triangle2 As shape

    reportName = "Triangle resize report"
    Set shapeReport = ActiveProject.Reports.Add(reportName)
    
    With shapeReport.Shapes
        Set triangle1 = .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 10, 10, 100, 100)
        Set triangle2 = .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 150, 10, 100, 100)
    End With
    
    triangle1.Select
    triangle1.LockAspectRatio = msoFalse
    triangle1.height = 200
    
    triangle2.Select
    triangle2.LockAspectRatio = msoTrue
    triangle2.height = 200
End Sub
```

In Figure 1, the right shape with the locked aspect ratio is selected.
