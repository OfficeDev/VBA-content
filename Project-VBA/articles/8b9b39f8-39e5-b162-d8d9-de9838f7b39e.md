Sub ActivateBookmarkedWindow() 
 
 Dim IsOpen As Boolean ' Whether or not the current bookmarked window is open 
 Dim I As Long ' Index for For...Next loop 
 
 IsOpen = False ' Assume the bookmarked window is not open. 
 
 For I = 1 To Windows.Count ' Look for the current bookmarked window. 
 If LCase(Windows(I).Caption) = LCase(BookmarkedWindowName) Then 
 IsOpen = True 
 Exit For 
 End If 
 Next I 
 
 ' If the current bookmarked window is not open or defined, then run 
 ' the ChangeBookmarkedWindow procedure. 
 If Len(BookmarkedWindowName) = 0 Or Not IsOpen Then 
 MsgBox ("The current bookmarked window is not open or has not been defined.") 
 ChangeBookmarkedWindowName 
 ' If the bookmarked window is open, activate it. 
 Else 
 WindowActivate (BookmarkedWindowName) 
 End If
