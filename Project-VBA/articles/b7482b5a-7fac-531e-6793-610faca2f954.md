# Tasks Object (Project)

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

Contains a collection of  ** [Task](bc6bb4a5-95a6-9d1f-3e28-92b9548a544a.md)** objects.

## Example

 **Using the Task Object**

Use  **Tasks** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the task index number or task name, to return a single **Task** object. The following example prints the names of every resource assigned to every task in the active project.




```
Dim Temp As Long, A As Assignment 

Dim TaskName As String, Assigned As String, Results As String 

 

For Temp = 1 To ActiveProject.Tasks.Count 

 TaskName = "Task: " &amp; ActiveProject.Tasks(Temp).Name &amp; vbCrLf 

 For Each A In ActiveProject.Tasks(Temp).Assignments 

 Assigned = A.ResourceName &amp; ListSeparator &amp; " " &amp; Assigned 

 Next A 

 Results = Results &amp; TaskName &amp; "Resources: " &amp; _ 

 Left$(Assigned, Len(Assigned) - Len(ListSeparator &amp; " ")) &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf 

 TaskName = "" 

 Assigned = "" 

Next Temp 

 

MsgBox Results
```

Use the  ** [Tasks](8f58ea8e-a3a1-f5aa-ad5d-6447fe777453.md)** property to return a **Tasks** collection. The following example displays the name of every task in the selection.




```
Dim T As Task, Names As String 

 

For Each T In ActiveSelection.Tasks 

 Names = Names &amp; T.Name &amp; vbCrLf 

Next T 

 

MsgBox Names
```

Use the  ** [Add](a6e2186b-610c-0888-a22a-8b7deba3f53f.md)** method to add a **Task** object to the **Tasks** collection. The following example adds a new task to the end of the task list.




```
ActiveProject.Tasks.Add "Hang clocks"
```
